Harkness."



He raised his arm, letting the sand run through his fingers. The beach

was big and dazzling white around them, the sea galloped in with a

steady roar, and a gull rode the breeze overhead. "What was wrong with

it?" he asked. "For a professional monicker, I mean."



She laughed and shook the long hair back over her shoulders. "I wanted

to live under the name of Sanders," she explained.



"Oh--oh, yes, of course. Winnie the Pooh." He grinned. "Soulmates,

that's what we are." It was about then that he decided he'd been a

bachelor long enough.



In the fall she went to New York to begin the upward grind--understudy,

walk-on parts, shoestring-theaters, and roles in outright turkeys.

Fraser returned to Boston for awhile, but his work suffered, he had to

keep dashing off to see her.



By spring she was beginning to get places; she had talent and everybody

enjoys looking at a brown-eyed blonde. His weekly proposals were also

beginning to show some real progress, and he thought that a month or two

of steady siege might finish the campaign. So he took leave from his job

and went down to New York himself. He'd saved up enough money, and was

good enough in his work, to afford it; anyway, he was his own

boss--consulting engineer, specializing in mathematical analysis.



He got a furnished room in Brooklyn, and filled in his leisure time--as

he thought of it--with some special math courses at Columbia. And he had

a lot of friends in town, in a curious variety of professions. Next to

Judy, he saw most of the physicist Sworsky, who was an entertaining

companion though most of his work was too top-secret even to be

mentioned. It was a happy period.



There is always a jarring note, to be sure. In this case, it was the

fact that Fraser had plenty of competition. He wasn't good-looking

himself--a tall gaunt man of twenty-eight, with a dark hatchet face and

perpetually-rumpled clothes. But still, Judy saw more of him than of

anyone else, and admitted she was seriously considering his proposal and

no other.




"Oh, get off it, Galahad. I'll meet you in the Dixie lobby at seven.

Okay?" She blew him a kiss over the wires, and hung up before he could

argue further. He sighed and shrugged. Why not, if she wanted to?



They were in a little Hungarian restaurant, with a couple of Tzigani

strolling about playing for them alone, it seemed, when he asked for

details. "Did you get a bonus, or what?"



"No." She laughed at him over her drink. "I've turned guinea pig."



"I hope you quit _that_ job before we're married!"



"It's a funny deal," she said thoughtfully. "It'd interest you. I've

been out a couple of times with this Snyder, you know, and if anything

was needed to drive me into your arms, Colin, it's his political

lectures."



"Well, bless the Republican Party!" He laid his hand over hers, she

didn't withdraw it, but she frowned just a little.



"Colin, you know I want to get somewhere before I marry--see a bit of

the world, the theatrical world, before turning hausfrau. Don't be

so--Oh, never mind. I like you anyway."



Sipping her drink and setting it down again: "Well, to carry on with the

story. I finally gave Comrade Snyder the complete brush-off, and I must

say he took it very nicely. But today, this morning, he called asking me

to have lunch with him, and I did after he explained. It seems he's got

a psychiatrist friend doing research, measuring brain storms or

something, and--Do I mean storms? Waves, I guess. Anyway, he wants to

measure as many different kinds of people as possible, and Snyder had

suggested me. I was supposed to come in for three afternoons

running--about two hours each time--and I'd get a hundred dollars per

session."



"Hm," said Fraser. "I didn't know psych research was that well-heeled.

Who is this mad scientist?"



"His name is Kennedy. Oh, by the way, I'm not supposed to tell anybody;

they want to spring it on the world as a surprise or something. But

you're different, Colin. I'm excited; I want to talk to somebody about

downright horrible.... Anyway, that's all there was to it. After a

couple of hours he gave me a check for a hundred dollars and told me to

come back tomorrow."



"Hm." Fraser rubbed his chin. "Apparently he was measuring the electric

rhythms corresponding to pleasure and dislike. I'd no idea anybody'd

made an encephalograph that accurate."



"Well," said Judy, "I've told you why we're celebrating. Now come on,

the regular orchestra's tuning up. Let's dance."



They had a rather wonderful evening. Afterward Fraser lay awake for a

long time, not wanting to lose a state of happiness in sleep. He

considered sleep a hideous waste of time: if he lived to be ninety, he'd

have spent almost thirty years unconscious.



       *       *       *       *       *



Judy was engaged for the next couple of evenings, and Fraser himself was

invited to dinner at Sworsky's the night after that. So it wasn't till

the end of the week that he called her again.



"Hullo, sweetheart," he said exuberantly. "How's things? I refer to

Charles Addams Things, of course."



"Oh--Colin." Her voice was very small, and it trembled.



"Look, I've got two tickets to _H. M. S. Pinafore_. So put on your own

pinafore and meet me."



"Colin--I'm sorry, Colin. I can't."



"Huh?" He noticed how odd she sounded, and a leadenness grew within him.

"You aren't sick, are you?"



"Colin, I--I'm going to be married."



"_What?_"



"Yes. I'm in love now; really in love. I'll be getting married in a

couple of months."



"But--but--"



"I didn't want to hurt you." He heard her begin to cry.



"But who--how--"



"It's Matthew," she gulped. "Matthew Snyder."



He sat quiet for a long while, until she asked if he was still on the

line. "Yeah," he said tonelessly. "Yeah, I'm still here, after a





"_Snyder!_" He made it a curse. "Remember what you told me about him

before?"



"I felt different then," she whispered. "He's a wonderful man when you

get to know him."



_And rich._ He suppressed the words and the thought. "What's so

wonderful specifically?" he asked.



"He--" Briefly, her face was rapt. Fraser had seen her looking at him

that way, now and then.



"Go on," he said grimly. "Enumerate Mr. Snyder's good qualities. Make a

list. He's courteous, cultured, intelligent, young, handsome,

amusing--To hell! _Why_, Judy?"



"I don't know," she said in a high, almost fearful tone. "I just love

him, that's all." She reached over the table and stroked his cheek. "I

like you a lot, Colin. Find yourself a nice girl and be happy."



His mouth drew into a narrow line. "There's something funny here," he

said. "Is it blackmail?"



"No!" She stood up, spilling her drink, and the flare of temper showed

him how overwrought she was. "He just happens to be the man I love.

That's enough out of you, good-bye, Mr. Fraser."



He sat watching her go. Presently he took up his drink, gulped it

barbarously, and called for another.









2





Juan Martinez had come from Puerto Rico as a boy and made his own way

ever since. Fraser had gotten to know him in the army, and they had seen

each other from time to time since then. Martinez had gone into the

private-eye business and made a good thing of it; Fraser had to get past

a very neat-looking receptionist to see him.



"Hi, Colin," said Martinez, shaking hands. He was a small, dark man,

with a large nose and beady black eyes that made him resemble a

sympathetic mouse. "You look like the very devil."



"I feel that way, too," said Fraser, collapsing into a chair. "You can't

go on a three-day drunk without showing it."



"Well, what's the trouble? Cigarette?" Martinez held out a pack.

"Girl-friend give you the air?"


than any other city except Paris. Latch on to somebody else. Or if you

want, I can give you a phone number--"



"You don't understand," said Fraser "I want you to investigate this; I

want to know why she did it."



Martinez squinted through a haze of smoke. "Snyder's a rich and powerful

man," he said. "Isn't that enough?"



"No," said Fraser, too tired to be angry at the hint. "Judy isn't that

kind of a girl. Neither is she the kind to go overboard in a few days,

especially when I was there. Sure, that sounds conceited, but dammit, I

_know_ she cared for me."



"Okay. You suspect pressure was brought to bear?"



"Yeah. It's hard to imagine what. I called up Judy's family in Maine,

and they said they were all right, no worries. Nor do I think anything

in her own life would give a blackmailer or an extortionist anything to

go on. Still--I want to know."



Martinez drummed the desk-top with nervous fingers. "I'll look into it

if you insist," he said, "though it'll cost you a pretty penny. Rich

men's lives aren't easy to pry into if they've got something they want

to hide. But I don't think we'd find out much; your case seems to be

only one of a rash of similar ones in the past year."



"Huh?" Fraser looked sharply up.



"Yeah. I follow all the news; and remember the odd facts. There've been

a good dozen cases recently, where beautiful young women suddenly

married rich men or became their mistresses. It doesn't all get into the

papers, but I've got my contacts. I know. In every instance, there was

no obvious reason; in fact, the dames seemed very much in love with

daddy."



"And the era of the gold-digger is pretty well gone--" Fraser sat

staring out the window. It didn't seem right that the sky should be so

full of sunshine.



"Well," said Martinez, "you don't need me. You need a psychologist."



_Psychologist!_



"By God, Juan, I'm going to give you a job anyway!" Fraser leaped to his




"I've found out a good bit, but it's all legitimate," said Martinez.

"He's about fifty years old, a widower, very steady private life. He's a

licensed psychiatrist who used to practice in Chicago, where he also did

research in collaboration with a physicist named Gavotti, who's since

died. Shortly after that happened--



"No, there's no suspicion of foul play; the physicist was an old man and

died of a heart attack. Anyway, Kennedy moved to New York. He still

practices, officially, but he doesn't take just anybody; claims that his

research only leaves him time for a few." Martinez narrowed his eyes.

"The only thing you could hold against him is that he occasionally sees

a guy named Bryce, who's in a firm that has some dealings with Amtorg."



"The Russian trading corporation? Hm."



"Oh, that's pretty remote guilt by association, Colin. Amtorg does have

legitimate business, you know. We buy manganese from them, among other

things. And the rest of Kennedy's connections are all strictly blue

ribbon. _Crème de la crème_--business, finance, politics, and one big

union-leader who's known to be a conservative. In fact, Kennedy's

friends are so powerful you'd have real trouble doing anything against

him."



Fraser slumped in his chair. "I suppose my notion was pretty wild," he

admitted.



"Well, there is one queer angle. You know these rich guys who've

suddenly made out with such highly desirable dames? As far as I could

find out, every one of them is a client of Kennedy's."



"Eh?" Fraser jerked erect.



"'S a fact. Also, my man showed the building staff, elevator pilots and

so on, pictures of these women, and a couple of 'em were remembered as

having come to see Kennedy."



"Shortly before they--fell in love?"



"Well, that I can't be sure of. You know how people are about

remembering dates. But it's possible."



Fraser shook his dark head. "It's unbelievable," he said. "I thought

Svengali was outworn melodrama."



"I know something about hypnotism, Colin. It won't do anything like what

you think happened to those girls."

young woman working at each, and two burly men who sat boredly reading

magazines.



The pretty girl, obviously the receptionist, looked up as Fraser

approached and gave him a professional smile. "Yes, sir?" she asked.



"I'd like to see Dr. Kennedy, please," he said, trying hard to be

casual.



"Do you have an appointment, sir?"



"No, but it's urgent."



"I'm sorry, sir; Dr. Kennedy is very busy. He can't see anybody except

his regular patients and research subjects."



"Look, take him in this note, will you? Thanks."



Fraser sat uneasily for some minutes, wondering if he'd worded the note

correctly. _I must see you about Miss Judy Harkness._ _Important._ Well,

what the devil else could you say?



The receptionist came out again. "Dr. Kennedy can spare you a few

minutes, sir," she said. "Go right on in."



"Thanks." Fraser slouched toward the inner door. The two men lowered

their magazines to follow him with watchful eyes.



There was a big, handsomely-furnished office inside, with a door beyond

that must lead to the laboratory. Kennedy looked up from some papers and

rose, holding out his hand. He was a medium-sized man, rather plump,

graying hair brushed thickly back from a broad, heavy face behind

rimless glasses. "Yes?" His voice was low and pleasant. "What can I do

for you?"



"My name's Fraser." The visitor sat down and accepted a cigarette. Best

to act urbanely. "I know Miss Harkness well. I understand you made some

encephalographic studies of her."



"Indeed?" Kennedy looked annoyed, and Fraser recalled that Judy had been

asked not to tell anyone. "I'm not sure; I would have to consult my

records first." He wasn't admitting anything, thought Fraser.



"Look," said the engineer, "there's been a marked change in Miss

Harkness recently. I know enough psychology to be certain that such

changes don't happen overnight without cause. I wanted to consult you."



"I'm not her psychiatrist," said Kennedy coldly. "Now if you will excuse

me, I really have a lot to do--"



"All right," said Fraser. There was no menace in his tones, only a


out, please," he said.



Fraser debated whether to put up a fight, decided it was futile, and

went out between the two others. When he got to the street, he found he

was shaking, and badly in need of a drink.



       *       *       *       *       *



Fraser asked, "Jim, did you ever read _Trilby_?"



Sworsky's round, freckled face lifted to regard him. "Years ago," he

answered. "What of it?"



"Tell me something. Is it possible--even theoretically possible--to do

what Svengali did? Change emotional attitudes, just like that." Fraser

snapped his fingers.



"I don't know," said Sworsky. "Nuclear cross-sections are more in my

line. But offhand, I should imagine it might be done ... sometime in the

far future. Thought-habits, associational-patterns, the labeling of this

as good and that as bad, seem to be matters of established neural paths.

If you could selectively alter the polarization of individual

neurones--But it's a pretty remote prospect; we hardly know a thing

about the brain today."



He studied his friend sympathetically. "I know it's tough to get

jilted," he said, "but don't go off your trolley about it."



"I could stand it if someone else had gotten her in the usual kind of

way," said Fraser thinly. "But this--Look, let me tell you all I've

found out."



Sworsky shook his head at the end of the story. "That's a mighty wild

speculation," he murmured. "I'd forget it if I were you."



"Did you know Kennedy's old partner? Gavotti, at Chicago."



"Sure, I met him a few times. Nice old guy, very unworldly, completely

wrapped up in his work. He got interested in neurology from the physics

angle toward the end of his life, and contributed a lot to cybernetics.

What of it?"



"I don't know," said Fraser; "I just don't know. But do me a favor, will

you, Jim? Judy won't see me at all, but she knows you and likes you. Ask

"Colin's gotten a funny obsession," said Sworsky cautiously. "He thinks

Kennedy hypnotized you for Snyder. I keep telling him it's impossible,

but he can't get over the idea."



"Oh, no, no, no," she said with too much fervor. "It's nothing like

that. I'll tell you just what happened. We had those two measuring

sessions; it was kind of dull but nothing else. And then the third time

Kennedy did put me under hypnosis--he called it that, at least. I went

to sleep and woke up about an hour later and he sent me home. I felt all

good inside, happy, and shlo--slowly I began to see what Matt meant to

me.



"I called him up that evening. He said Kennedy's machine _did_ speed up

people's minds for a short while, sometimes, so they decided quick-like

what they'd've worked out anyway. Kennedy is--I don't know. It's funny

how ordinary he seemed at first. But when you get to know him, he's

like--God, almost. He's strong and wise and good. He--" Her voice

trailed off and she sat looking foolishly at her glass.



"You know," said Sworsky, "perhaps Colin is right after all."



"Don't say that!" She jumped up and slapped his face. "Kennedy's _good_,

I tell you! All you little lice sitting here making sly remarks behind

his back, and he's so, much bigger than all of you and--" She broke into

tears and stormed out of the apartment.



Sworsky reported the affair to Fraser. "I wonder," he said. "It doesn't

seem natural, I'll agree. But what can anybody do? The police?"



"I've tried," said Fraser dully. "They laughed. When I insisted, I damn

near got myself jugged. That's no use. The trouble is, none of the

people who've been under the machine will testify against Kennedy. He

fixes it so they worship him."



"I still think you're crazy. There _must_ be a simpler hypothesis; I

refuse to believe your screwy notions without some real evidence. But

what are you going to do now?"



"Well," said Fraser with a tautness in his voice, "I've got several

thousand dollars saved up, and Juan Martinez will help. Ever hear the




Fraser's heart sprang in his ribs, but he held his voice stiff. "Go on,

then. Talk."



"I want you to come up to my place. We may be having a long

conversation."



"Mmmm--well--" It was more than he had allowed himself to hope for, but

he remained curt: "Okay. But a full report of this business, and what I

think you're doing, is in the hands of several people. If anything

should happen to me--"



"You've been reading too many hard-boileds," said Kennedy. "Nothing will

happen. Anyway, I have a pretty good idea who those people are; I can

hire detectives of my own, you know."



"I'll come over, then." Fraser hung up and realized, suddenly, that he

was sweating.



The night air was cool as he walked down the street. He paused for a

moment, feeling the city like a huge impersonal machine around him,

grinding and grinding. Human civilization had grown too big, he thought.

It was beyond anyone's control; it had taken on a will of its own and

was carrying a race which could no longer guide it. Sometimes--reading

the papers, or listening to the radio, or just watching the traffic go

by like a river of steel--a man could feel horribly helpless.



He took the subway to Kennedy's address, a swank apartment in the lower

Fifties. He was admitted by the psychiatrist in person; no one else was

around.



"I assume," said Kennedy, "that you don't have some wild idea of pulling

a gun on me. That would accomplish nothing except to get you in

trouble."



"No," said Fraser, "I'll be good." His eyes wandered about the living

room. One wall was covered with books which looked used; there were some

quality reproductions, a Capehart, and fine, massive furniture. It was a

tasteful layout. He looked a little more closely at three pictures on

the mantel: a middle-aged woman and two young men in uniform.



"My wife," said Kennedy, "and my boys. They're all dead. Would you like

a drink?"



"No. I came to talk."



"I'm not Satan, you know," said Kennedy. "I like books and music, good

"I want my girl back," said Fraser tonelessly. "I was hoping my

nuisance-value--"



       *       *       *       *       *



Kennedy winced a bit. "You know, I'm damned sorry about that. It's the

one aspect of my work which I hate. I'd like you to believe that I'm not

just a scientific procurer. Actually, I have to satisfy the minor

desires of my clients, so they'll stay happy and agree to my major

wishes. It's the plain truth that those women have been only the

minutest fraction of my job."



"Nevertheless, you're a free-wheeling son, doing something like that--"



"Really, now, what's so horrible about it? Those girls are in love--the

normal, genuine article. It's not any kind of zombie state, or whatever

your overheated imagination has thought up. They're entirely sane,

unharmed, and happy. In fact, happiness of that kind is so rare in this

world that if I wanted to, I could pose as their benefactor."



"You've got a machine," said Fraser; "it changes the mind. As far as I'm

concerned, that's as gross a violation of liberty as throwing somebody

into a concentration camp."



"How free do you think anyone is? You're born with a fixed heredity.

Environment molds you like clay. Your society teaches you what and how

to think. A million tiny factors, all depending on blind, uncontrollable

chance, determine the course of your life--including your love-life....

Well, we needn't waste any time on philosophy. Go on, ask some

questions. I admit I've hurt you--unwittingly, to be sure--but I do want

to make amends."



"Your machine, then," said Fraser. "How did you get it? How does it

work."



"I was practicing in Chicago," said Kennedy, "and collaborating on the

side with Gavotti. How much do you know of cybernetics? I don't mean

computers and automata, which are only one aspect of the field; I mean

control and communication, in the animal as well as in the machine."





theory and its circuits myself. But look, you know something of

encephalography. The various basic rhythms of the brain have been

measured. The standard method is already so sensitive that it can detect

abnormalities like a developing tumor or a strong emotional disturbance,

that will give trouble unless corrected. Half of Gavotti's machine is a

still more delicate encephalograph. It can measure and analyze the

minute variations in electrical pulses corresponding to the basic

emotional states. It won't read thoughts, no; but once calibrated for a

given individual, it will tell you if he's happy, sorrowful, angry,

disgusted, afraid--any fundamental neuro-glandular condition, or any

combination of them."



He paused. "All right," said Fraser. "What else does it do?"



"It does _not_ make monsters," said Kennedy. "Look, the specific

emotional reaction to a given stimulus is, in the normal individual,

largely a matter of conditioned reflex, instilled by social environment

or the accidental associations of his life.



"Anyone in decent health will experience fear in the presence of

danger; desire in the presence of a sexual object, and so on. That's

basic biology, and the machine can't change that. But most of our

evaluations are learned. For instance, to an American the word 'mother'

has powerful emotional connotations, while to a Samoan it means nothing

very exciting. You had to develop a taste for liquor, tobacco,

coffee--in fact most of what you consume. If you're in love with a

particular woman, it's a focusing of the general sexual libido on her,

brought about by the symbolizing part of your mind: she _means_

something to you. There are cultures without romantic love, you know.

And so on. All these specific, conditioned reactions can be changed."



"How?"



       *       *       *       *       *



Kennedy thought for a moment "The encephalographic part of the machine

measures the exact pulsations in the individual corresponding to the

various emotional reactions. It takes me about four hours to determine

those with the necessary precision; then I have to make statistical

Kennedy leaned forward with an air of urgency. "The end result is in no

way different from ordinary means of persuasion. Propaganda does the

same thing by sheer repetition. If you're courting a girl, you try to

identify yourself in her mind with the things she desires, by

appropriate behavior.... I'm sorry; I shouldn't have used that

example.... The machine is only a direct, fast way of doing this,

producing a more stable result."



"It's still--tampering," said Fraser. "How do you know you're not

creating side-effects, doing irreparable long-range damage?"



"Oh, for Lord's sake!" exploded Kennedy. "Take your mind off that shelf,

will you? I've told you how delicate the whole thing is. A few

microwatts of power more or less, a frequency-shift of less than one

percent, and it doesn't work at all. There's no effect whatsoever." He

cooled off fast, adding reflectively: "On the given subject, that is. It

might work on someone else. These pulsations are a highly individual

matter; I have to calibrate every case separately."



There was a long period of silence. Then Fraser strained forward and

said in an ugly voice:



"All right You've told me how you do it. Now tell me _why_. What

possible reason or excuse, other than your own desire to play God? This

thing could be the greatest psychiatric tool in history, and you're

using it to--pimp!"



"I told you that was unimportant," said Kennedy quietly. "I'm doing much

more. I set up in practice here in New York a couple of years ago. Once

I had a few chance people under control--no, I tell you again, I didn't

make robots of them. I merely associated myself, in their own minds,

with the father-image. That's something I do to everyone who comes under

the machine, just as a precaution if nothing else, Kennedy is all-wise,

all-powerful; Kennedy can do no wrong. It isn't a conscious realization;

to the waking mind, I am only a shrewd adviser and a damn swell fellow.

But the subconscious mind knows otherwise. It wouldn't _let_ my subjects

act against me; it wouldn't even let them want to.



"Well, you see how it goes. I got those first few people to recommend me


persuade these other people--they only know that I do, somehow, and

their regard for their own egos, as well as for me, sets up a bloc which

prevents them from reasoning out the fact that they themselves are

dominated. They're quite content to accept the results of my help,

without inquiring further into the means than the easy rationalization

that I have a 'persuasive personality.'



"I don't like what I'm doing, Fraser. But it's got to be done."



"You still haven't said _what's_ got to be done," answered the engineer

coldly.



"I've been given something unbelievable," said Kennedy. His voice was

very soft now. "If I'd made it public, can you imagine what would have

happened? Psychiatrists would use it, yes; but so would criminals,

dictators, power-hungry men of all kinds. Even in this country, I don't

think libertarian principles could long survive. It would be too

simple--



"And yet it would have been cowardly to break the machine and burn

Gavotti's notes. Chance has given me the power to be more than a chip in

the river--a river that's rapidly approaching a waterfall, war,

destruction, tyranny, no matter who the Pyrrhic victor may be. I'm in a

position to do something for the causes in which I believe."



"And what are they?" asked Fraser.



Kennedy gestured at the pictures on the mantel. "Both my sons were

killed in the last war. My wife died of cancer--a disease which would be

licked now if a fraction of the money spent on armaments had been

diverted to research. That brought it home to me; but there are hundreds

of millions of people in worse cases. And war isn't the only

evil--there is poverty, oppression, inequality, want and suffering. It

could be changed.



"I'm building up my own lobby, you might say. In a few more years, I

hope to be the indispensable adviser of all the men who, between them,

really run this country. And yes, I have been in touch with Soviet

agents--have even acted as a transmitter of stolen information. The

basic problem of spying, you know, is not to get the information in the

suppress the story, if you should get it out somehow. And if you give me

any more trouble at all, I'll see to it that you--stop."



"Murder?"



"Or commitment to an asylum. I can arrange that too."



Fraser sighed. He felt oddly unexcited, empty, as if the interview had

drained him of his last will to resist. He held the pipe loosely in his

fingers, letting it go out.



"Ask me a favor," urged Kennedy. "I'll do it, if it won't harm my own

program. I tell you, I want to square things."



"Well--"



"Think about it. Let me know."



"All right." Fraser got up. "I may do that." He went out the door

without saying goodnight.

He sat with his feet on the table, chair tilted back and teetering

dangerously, hands clasped behind his head, pipe filling the room with

blue fog. It was his usual posture for attacking a problem.



And damn it, he thought wearily, this was a question such as he made his

living on. An industrial engineer comes into the office. We want this

and that--a machine for a very special purpose, let's say. What should

we do, Mr. Fraser? Fraser prowls around the plant, reads up on the

industry, and then sits down and thinks. The elements of the problem are

such-and-such; how can they be combined to yield a solution?



Normally, he uses the mathematical approach, especially in machine

design. Most practicing-engineers have a pathetic math background--they

use ten pages of elaborate algebra and rusty calculus to figure out

something that three vector equations would solve. But you have to get

the logical basics straight first, before you can set up your equations.



All right, what is the problem? To get Judy back. That means forcing

Kennedy to restore her normal emotional reactions--no, he didn't want

her thrust into love of him; he just wanted her as she had been.



What are the elements of the problem? Kennedy acts outside the law, but

he has blocked all official channels. He even has connections extending




In fact, whatever the counter-attack, it was necessary to go warily.

Kennedy's threat to get rid of Fraser if the engineer kept working

against him was not idle mouthing. He could do it--and, being a fanatic,

would.



But Kennedy, like the demon of legend, would grant one wish--just to

salve his own conscience. Only what should the wish be? Another woman?

Or merely to be reconciled, artificially, to an otherwise-intolerable

situation?



_Judy, Judy, Judy!_



Fraser swore at himself. Damn it to hell, this was a problem in logic.

No room for emotion. Of course, it might be a problem without a

solution. There are plenty of those.



He squinted, trying to visualize the office. He thought of burglary,

stealing evidence--silly thought. But let's see, now. What was the

layout, exactly? Four suites on one floor of the skyscraper, three of

them unimportant offices of unimportant men. And--



_Oh, Lord!_



Fraser sat for a long while, hardly moving. Then he uncoiled himself and

ran, downstairs and into the street and to the nearest pay phone. His

own line might be tapped--



"Hello, hello, Juan?... Yes, I know I got you out of bed, and I'm not

sorry. This is too bloody important.... Okay, okay.... Look, I want a

complete report on the Messenger Advertising Service.... When?

Immediately, if not sooner. And I mean _complete_.... That's right,

Messenger.... Okay, fine. I'll buy you a drink sometime."



"Hello, Jim? Were you asleep too?... Sorry.... But look, would you make

a list of all the important men you know fairly well? I need it bad....

No, don't come over. I think I'd better not see you for a while. Just

mail it to me.... All right, so I am paranoid...."



       *       *       *       *       *



Jerome K. Ferris was a large man, with a sense of his own importance

that was even larger. He sat hunched in the chair, his head dwarfed by



"As even, as we'll ever get, I suppose," said Fraser.



"I wish you'd trust me," said Kennedy with a hint of wistfulness. "I'd

have done the job honestly; you didn't have to watch."



"Well, I was interested," said Fraser.



"Frankly, I still don't see what you stand to gain by the doglike

devotion of this Ferris. He's rich, but he's too weak and short-sighted

to be a leader. I'd never planned on conditioning him for my purposes."



"I've explained that," said Fraser patiently. "Ferris is a large

stockholder in a number of corporations. His influence can swing a lot

of business my way."



"Yes, I know. I didn't grant your wish blindly, you realize. I had

Ferris studied; he's unable to harm me." Kennedy regarded Fraser with

hard eyes. "And just in case you still have foolish notions, please

remember that I gave him the father-conditioning with respect to myself.

He'll do a lot for you, but not if it's going to hurt me in any way."



"I know when I'm licked," said Fraser bleakly; "I'm getting out of town

as soon as I finish those courses I'm signed up for."



Kennedy snapped his fingers. "All right, Ferris, wake up now."



Ferris blinked. "What's been happening?" he asked.



"Nothing much," said Kennedy, unbuckling the electrodes. "I've taken my

readings. Thank you very much for the help, sir. I'll see that you get

due credit when my research is published."



"Ah--yes. Yes." Ferris puffed himself out. Then he put an arm around

Fraser's shoulder. "If you aren't busy," he said, "maybe we could go

have lunch."



"Thanks," said Fraser. "I'd like to talk to you about a few things."



He lingered for a moment after Ferris had left the room. "I imagine this

is goodbye for us," he said.



"Well, so long, at least. We'll probably hear from each other again."

Kennedy shook Fraser's hand. "No hard feelings? I did go to a lot of

trouble for you--wangling your introduction to Ferris when you'd named

him, and having one of my men persuade him to come here. And right when


"You're getting a persecution-complex. Honest, Colin, I'm worried."



"Well, bear with me for a while. Now, have you had any information on

Kennedy since I called last?"



"Hm, no. I did mention to Thomson, as you asked me to, that I'd heard

rumors of some revolutionary encephalographic techniques and would be

interested in seeing the work. Why did you want me to do that?"



"Thomson," said Fraser, "is one of Kennedy's men. Now look, Jim, before

long you're going to be invited to visit Kennedy. He'll give you a spiel

about his research and ask to measure your brain waves. I want you to

say yes. Then I want to know the exact times of the three appointments

he'll give you--the first two, at least."



"Hmmm--if Kennedy's doing what you claim--"



"Jim, it's a necessary risk, but _I'm_ the one who's taking it. You'll

be okay, I promise you; though perhaps later you'll read of me being

found in the river. You see, I got Kennedy to influence a big stockowner

for me. One of the lesser companies in which he has a loud voice is

Messenger. I don't suppose Kennedy knows that. I hope not!"



       *       *       *       *       *



Sworsky looked as if he'd been sandbagged. He was white, and the hand

that poured a drink shook.



"Lord," he muttered. "Lord, Colin, you were right."



Fraser's teeth drew back from his lips. "You went through with it, eh?"



"Yes. I let the son hypnotize me, and afterward I walked off with a

dreamy expression, as you told me to. Just three hours ago, he dropped

around here in person. He gave me a long rigmarole about the stupidity

of military secrecy, and how the Soviet Union stands for peace and

justice. I hope I acted impressed; I'm not much of an actor."



"You don't have to be. Just so you didn't overdo it. To one of Kennedy's

"Listen before you do anything," said Fraser harshly. "I know you tried

to bring Jim Sworsky under the influence. You asked him for top-secret

data. A few hours ago, you handed the file he brought you on to Bryce,

who's no doubt at the Amtorg offices this minute. That's high treason,

Kennedy; they execute people for doing that."



The psychologist slumped back.



"Don't try to have your bully boys get rid of me," said Fraser. "Sworsky

is sitting by the phone, waiting to call the FBI. I'm the only guy who

can stop him."



"But--" Kennedy's tongue ran around his lips. "But he committed treason

himself. He gave me the papers!"



Fraser grinned. "You don't think those were authentic, do you? I doubt

if you'll be very popular in the Soviet Union either, once they've tried

to build machines using your data."



Kennedy looked down at the floor. "How did you do it?" he whispered.



"Remember Ferris? The guy you fixed up for me? He owns a share of your

next-door neighbor, the Messenger Advertising Service. I fed him a song

and dance about needing an office to do some important work, only my

very whereabouts had to be secret. The Messenger people were moved out

without anybody's knowing. I installed myself there one night, also a

simple little electric oscillator.



"Encephalography is damn delicate work; it involves amplifications up to

several million. The apparatus misbehaves if you give it a hard look.

Naturally, your lab and the machine were heavily shielded, but even so,

a radio emitter next door would be bound to throw you off. My main

trouble was in lousing you up just a little bit, not enough to make you

suspect anything.



"I only worked at that during your calibrating sessions with Sworsky. I

didn't have to be there when you turned the beam on him, because it

would be calculated from false data and be so far from his pattern as to

have no effect. You told me yourself how precise an adjustment was

needed. Sworsky played along, then. Now we've got proof--not that you

meddled with human lives, but that you are a spy."


talked his way into the Columbia University laboratories, where

Gavotti's puzzling machine was being studied, and pulled out a hammer

and smashed it into ruin before he could be stopped. Taken to jail, he

committed suicide in his cell. The name was Kennedy.



Fraser felt vague regret, but it didn't take him long to forget it; he

was too busy making plans for his wedding.
