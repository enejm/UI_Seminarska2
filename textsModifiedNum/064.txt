My Uncle's Gift Is Many Times Multiplied        CHAPTER I    THE MAN ON THE KIRKCAPLE SHORE    I mind as if it were yesterday my first sight of the man.  Little I  knew at the time how big the moment was with destiny, or how often that  face seen in the fitful moonlight would haunt my sleep and disturb my  waking hours.  But I mind yet the cold grue of terror I got from it, a  terror which was surely more than the due of a few truant lads breaking  the Sabbath with their play.    The town of Kirkcaple, of which and its adjacent parish of Portincross  my father was the minister, lies on a hillside above the little bay of  Caple, and looks squarely out on the North Sea.  Round the horns of  land which enclose the bay the coast shows on either side a battlement  of stark red cliffs through which a burn or two makes a pass to the  water's edge.  The bay itself is ringed with fine clean sands, where we 
human habitation.  This was a farm about half a mile inland, and when  we reached it we lay down by the stack-yard gate and panted.    'I've lost my lantern,' said Tam.  'The big black brute!  See if I  don't tell my father.'    'Ye'll do nothing of the kind,' said Archie fiercely.  'He knows  nothing about us and can't do us any harm.  But if the story got out  and he found out who we were, he'd murder the lot of US.'    He made us swear secrecy, which we were willing enough to do, seeing  very clearly the sense in his argument.  Then we struck the highroad  and trotted back at our best pace to Kirkcaple, fear of our families  gradually ousting fear of pursuit. In our excitement Archie and I  forgot about our Sabbath hats, reposing quietly below a whin bush on  the links.    We were not destined to escape without detection.  As ill luck would  have it, Mr Murdoch had been taken ill with the stomach-ache after the  second psalm, and the congregation had been abruptly dispersed.  My  mother had waited for me at the church door, and, seeing no signs of  her son, had searched the gallery.  Then the truth came out, and, had I  been only for a mild walk on the links, retribution would have  overtaken my truantry.  But to add to this I arrived home with a  scratched face, no hat, and several rents in my best trousers.  I was  well cuffed and sent to bed, with the promise of full-dress  chastisement when my father should come home in the morning.    My father arrived before breakfast next day, and I was duly and soundly  whipped.  I set out for school with aching bones to add to the usual  depression of Monday morning.  At the corner of the Nethergate I fell  in with Archie, who was staring at a trap carrying two men which was  coming down the street. It was the Free Church minister--he had married  a rich wife and kept a horse--driving the preacher of yesterday to the  railway station.  Archie and I were in behind a doorpost in a 
You look as if you had a stiff back, so I'll be frank with you.  There  is something about the place.  It gives the ordinary man the jumps.  What it is, I don't know, and the men who come back don't know  themselves.  I want you to find out for me.  You'll be doing the firm  an enormous service if you can get on the track of it.  It may be the  natives, or it may be the takhaars, or it may be something else.  Only  old Japp can stick it out, and he's too old and doddering to care about  moving.  I want you to keep your eyes skinned, and write privately to  me if you want any help.  You're not out here for your health, I can  see, and here's a chance for you to get your foot on the ladder.    'Remember, I'm your friend,' he said to me again at the garden gate.  'Take my advice and lie very low.  Don't talk, don't meddle with drink,  learn all you can of the native jabber, but don't let on you understand  a word.  You're sure to get on the track of something.  Good-bye, my  boy,' and he waved a fat hand to me.    That night I embarked on a cargo-boat which was going round the coast  to Delagoa Bay.  It is a small world--at least for us far-wandering  Scots.  For who should I find when I got on board but my old friend Tam  Dyke, who was second mate on the vessel?  We wrung each other's hands,  and I answered, as best I could, his questions about Kirkcaple.  I had  supper with him in the cabin, and went on deck to see the moorings cast.    Suddenly there was a bustle on the quay, and a big man with a handbag  forced his way up the gangway.  The men who were getting ready to cast  off tried to stop him, but he elbowed his way forward, declaring he  must see the captain.  Tam went up to him and asked civilly if he had a  passage taken.  He admitted he had not, but said he would make it right 
koodoo.  At first I was a complete duffer, and shamed myself in Colin's  eyes.  But by-and-by I learned something of veld-craft: I learned how  to follow spoor, how to allow for the wind, and stalk under cover.  Then, when a shot had crippled the beast, Colin was on its track like a  flash to pull it down.  The dog had the nose of a retriever, the speed  of a greyhound, and the strength of a bull-terrier.  I blessed the day  when the wandering prospector had passed the store.    Colin slept at night at the foot of my bed, and it was he who led me to  make an important discovery.  For I now became aware that I was being  subjected to constant espionage.  It may have been going on from the  start, but it was not till my third month at Blaauwildebeestefontein  that I found it out.  One night I was going to bed, when suddenly the  bristles rose on the dog's back and he barked uneasily at the window.  I had been standing in the shadow, and as I stepped to the window to  look out I saw a black face disappear below the palisade of the  backyard.  The incident was trifling, but it put me on my guard.  The  next night I looked, but saw nothing.  The third night I looked, and  caught a glimpse of a face almost pressed to the pane.  Thereafter I  put up the shutters after dark, and shifted my bed to a part of the  room out of line with the window.    It was the same out of doors.  I would suddenly be conscious, as I  walked on the road, that I was being watched.  If I made as if to walk  into the roadside bush there would be a faint rustling, which told that  the watcher had retired.  The stalking was brilliantly done, for I  never caught a glimpse of one of the stalkers.  Wherever I went--on the  road, on the meadows of the plateau, or on the rugged sides of the  Berg--it was the same.  I had silent followers, who betrayed themselves  now and then by the crackling of a branch, and eyes were always looking 
  I walked round the lake to look for an outlet.  A fine mountain stream  came in at the north end, and at the south end, sure enough, a  considerable river debauched.  My exploring zeal redoubled, and I  followed its course in a delirium of expectation.  It was a noble  stream, clear as crystal, and very unlike the muddy tropical Labongo at  Umvelos'.  Suddenly, about a quarter of a mile from the lake, the land  seemed to grow over it, and with a swirl and a hollow roar, it  disappeared into a mighty pot-hole.  I walked a few steps on, and from  below my feet came the most uncanny rumbling and groaning. Then I knew  what old Coetzee's devil was that howled in the Rooirand.    Had I continued my walk to the edge of the cliff, I might have learned  a secret which would have stood me in good stead later.  But the  descent began to make me anxious, and I retraced my steps to the top of  the chimney whence I had come.  I was resolved that nothing would make  me descend by that awesome crack, so I kept on eastward along the top  to look for a better way.  I found one about a mile farther on, which,  though far from easy, had no special risks save from the appalling  looseness of the _d√©bris_.  When I got down at length, I found that it  was near sunset.  I went to the place I had bidden my native look for  me at, but, as I had feared, there was no sign of him.  So, making the  best of a bad job, I had supper and a pipe, and spent a very chilly  night in a hole among the boulders.    I got up at dawn stiff and cold, and ate a few raisins for breakfast.  There was no sign of horses, so I resolved to fill up the time in  looking for the fold of the cliff which, as I had seen from the  horrible crack of yesterday, contained a gully.  It was a difficult  job, for to get the sidelong view of the cliff I had to scramble 
else they had gone after some distant business.  Except a batch of  three Shangaans returning from the Rand, I had nobody in the store for  the whole of one day.  So about four o'clock I shut it up, whistled on  Colin, and went for a walk along the Berg.    If there were no natives on the road, there were plenty in the bush.  I  had the impression, of which Wardlaw had spoken, that the native  population of the countryside had suddenly been hugely increased.  The  woods were simply _hotching_ with them.  I was being spied on as before,  but now there were so many at the business that they could not all  conceal their tracks.  Every now and then I had a glimpse of a black  shoulder or leg, and Colin, whom I kept on the leash, was half-mad with  excitement.  I had seen all I wanted, and went home with a preoccupied  mind.  I sat long on Wardlaw's garden-seat, trying to puzzle out the  truth of this spying.    What perplexed me was that I had been left unmolested when I had gone  to Umvelos'.  Now, as I conjectured, the secret of the neighbourhood,  whatever it was, was probably connected with the Rooirand.  But when I  had ridden in that direction and had spent two days in exploring, no  one had troubled to watch me.  I was quite certain about this, for my  eye had grown quick to note espionage, and it is harder for a spy to  hide in the spare bush of the flats than in the dense thickets on these  uplands.    The watchers, then, did not mind my fossicking round their sacred  place.  Why, then, was I so closely watched in the harmless  neighbourhood of the store?  I thought for a long time before an answer  occurred to me.  The reason must be that going to the plains I was  going into native country and away from civilization.  But  Blaauwildebeestefontein was near the frontier.  There must be some dark  business brewing of which they may have feared that I had an inkling.  They wanted to see if I proposed to go to Pietersdorp or Wesselsburg 
is a sore road for old bones.'    I went into the store to fetch some meal, and when I came out he had  shuffled close to the door.  He had kept his eyes on the ground, but  now he looked up at me, and I thought he had very bright eyes for such  an old wreck.    'The nights are cold, Inkoos,' he wailed, 'and my folk are scattered,  and I have no kraal.  The aasvogels follow me, and I can hear the  blesbok.' 'What about the blesbok?' I asked with a start.    'The blesbok are changing ground,' he said, and looked me straight in  the face.    'And where are the hunters?' I asked. 'They are here and behind me,' he  said in English, holding out his pot for my meal, while he began to  edge into the middle of the road.    I followed, and, speaking English, asked him if he knew of a man named  Colles.    'I come from him, young Baas.  Where is your house?  Ah, the school.  There will be a way in by the back window?  See that it is open, for  I'll be there shortly.'  Then lifting up his voice he called down in  Sesuto all manner of blessings on me for my kindness, and went  shuffling down the sunlit road, coughing like a volcano.    In high excitement I locked up the store and went over to Mr Wardlaw.  No children had come to school that day, and he was sitting idle,  playing patience.  'Lock the door,' I said, 'and come into my room.  We're on the brink of explanations.'    In about twenty minutes the bush below the back-window parted and the  Kaffir slipped out.  He grinned at me, and after a glance round, hopped  very nimbly over the sill.  Then he examined the window and pulled the  curtains.    'Is the outer door shut?' he asked in excellent English.  'Well, get me  some hot water, and any spare clothes you may possess, Mr Crawfurd.  I  must get comfortable before we begin our _indaba_.[2]  We've the night 
must know he has no chance in the long run.'    'I said he was an educated man, but he is also a Kaffir.  He can see  the first stage of a thing, and maybe the second, but no more.  That is  the native mind.  If it was not like that our chance would be the  worse.'    'You say the scheme is ripe,' I said; 'how ripe?'    Arcoll looked at the clock.  'In half an hour's time Laputa will be  with 'Mpefu.  There he will stay the night.  To-morrow morning he goes  to Umvelos' to meet Henriques.  To-morrow evening the gathering begins.'    'One question,' I said.  'How big a man is Laputa?'    'The biggest thing that the Kaffirs have ever produced.  I tell you, in  my opinion he is a great genius.  If he had been white he might have  been a second Napoleon.  He is a born leader of men, and as brave as a  lion.  There is no villainy he would not do if necessary, and yet I  should hesitate to call him a blackguard.  Ay, you may look surprised  at me, you two pragmatical Scotsmen; but I have, so to speak, lived  with the man for months, and there's fineness and nobility in him.  He  would be a terrible enemy, but a just one.  He has the heart of a poet  and a king, and it is God's curse that he has been born among the  children of Ham.  I hope to shoot him like a dog in a day or two, but I  am glad to bear testimony to his greatness.'    'If the rising starts to-morrow,' I asked, 'have you any of his plans?'    He picked up a map from the table and opened it.  'The first rendezvous  is somewhere near Sikitola's.  Then they move south, picking up  contingents; and the final concentration is to be on the high veld near  Amsterdam, which is convenient for the Swazis and the Zulus.  After  that I know nothing, but of course there are local concentrations along  the whole line of the Berg from Mashonaland to Basutoland.  Now, look 
and they were sure to shut and bolt the door.  I might conceal myself  among the barrels inside; but apart from the fact that they were likely  to search them before beginning their conference, it was quite certain  that they would satisfy themselves that I was safe in the other end of  the building before going to the outhouse.    Suddenly I thought of the cellar which we had built below the store.  There was an entrance by a trap-door behind the counter, and another in  the outhouse.  I had forgotten the details, but my hope was that the  second was among the barrels.  I shut the outer door, prised up the  trap, and dropped into the vault, which had been floored roughly with  green bricks.  Lighting match after match, I crawled to the other end  and tried to lift the door.  It would not stir, so I guessed that the  barrels were on the top of it.  Back to the outhouse I went, and found  that sure enough a heavy packing-case was standing on a corner.  I  fixed it slightly open, so as to let me hear, and so arranged the odds  and ends round about it that no one looking from the floor of the  outhouse would guess at its existence.  It occurred to me that the  conspirators would want seats, so I placed two cases at the edge of the  heap, that they might not be tempted to forage in the interior.    This done, I went back to the store and proceeded to rig myself out for  my part.  The cellar had made me pretty dirty, and I added some new  daubs to my face.  My hair had grown longish, and I ran my hands  through it till it stood up like a cockatoo's crest.  Then I cunningly  disposed the methylated spirits in the places most likely to smell.  I  burned a little on the floor, I spilt some on the counter and on my  hands, and I let it dribble over my coat.  In five minutes I had made  the room stink like a shebeen.  I loosened the collar of my shirt, and 
believed I saw the workings of Omnipotence.  Such is our moral  arrogance, and yet without such a belief I think that mankind would  have ever been content to bide sluggishly at home.    I passed the spot where on my former journey I had met the horses, and  knew that I had covered more than half the road. My ear had been alert  for the sound of pursuit, but the bush was quiet as the grave.  The man  who rode my pony would find him a slow traveller, and I pitied the poor  beast bucketed along by an angry rider.  Gradually a hazy wall of  purple began to shimmer before me, apparently very far off.  I knew the  ramparts of the Rooirand, and let my _schimmel_ feel my knees in his  ribs.  Within an hour I should be at the cliff's foot.    I had trusted for safety to the password, but as it turned out I owed  my life mainly to my horse.  For, a mile or so from the cliffs, I came  to the fringes of a great army.  The bush was teeming with men, and I  saw horses picketed in bunches, and a multitude of Cape-carts and light  wagons.  It was like a colossal gathering for _naachtmaal_[1] at a Dutch  dorp, but every man was black.  I saw through a corner of my eye that  they were armed with guns, though many carried in addition their spears  and shields.  Their first impulse was to stop me.  I saw guns fly to  shoulders, and a rush towards the path.  The boldest game was the  safest, so I dug my heels into the _schimmel_ and shouted for a passage.  'Make way!' I cried in Kaffir.  'I bear a message from the Inkulu.[2]  Clear out, you dogs!'    They recognized the horse, and fell back with a salute.  Had I but  known it, the beast was famed from the Zambesi to the Cape.  It was  their king's own charger I rode, and who dared question such a warrant?  I heard the word pass through the bush, and all down the road I got the  salute.  In that moment I fervently thanked my stars that I had got 
Phrases which the hearers had heard at mission schools now suddenly  appeared, not as the white man's learning, but as God's message to His  own.  Laputa fitted the key to the cipher, and the meaning was clear.  He concluded, I remember, with a picture of the overthrow of the alien,  and the golden age which would dawn for the oppressed.  Another  Ethiopian empire would arise, so majestic that the white man everywhere  would dread its name, so righteous that all men under it would live in  ease and peace.    By rights, I suppose, my blood should have been boiling at this  treason.  I am ashamed to confess that it did nothing of the sort.  My  mind was mesmerized by this amazing man.  I could not refrain from  shouting with the rest.  Indeed I was a convert, if there can be  conversion when the emotions are dominant and there is no assent from  the brain.  I had a mad desire to be of Laputa's party.  Or rather, I  longed for a leader who should master me and make my soul his own, as  this man mastered his followers.  I have already said that I might have  made a good subaltern soldier, and the proof is that I longed for such  a general.    As the voice ceased there was a deep silence.  The hearers were in a  sort of trance, their eyes fixed glassily on Laputa's face.  It was the  quiet of tense nerves and imagination at white-heat.  I had to struggle  with a spell which gripped me equally with the wildest savage.  I  forced myself to look round at the strained faces, the wall of the  cascade, the line of torches.  It was the sight of Henriques that broke  the charm.  Here was one who had no part in the emotion.  I caught his  eye fixed on the rubies, and in it I read only a devouring greed.  It  flashed through my mind that Laputa had a foe in his own camp, and the  Prester's collar a votary whose passion was not that of worship.    The next thing I remember was a movement among the first ranks.  The 
  He sat down beside me, and laughed softly.  'You heard my little story?  You are clever, Mr Storekeeper, but not quite clever enough.  What if I  can act a part as well as yourself?' And he thrust his yellow face  close to mine.    I saw his meaning, and did not for a second believe him; but I had the  sense to temporize.    'Do you mean to say that you did not kill the Dutchmen, and did not  mean to knife me?'    'I mean to say that I am not a fool,' he said, lighting another  cigarette.    'I am a white man, Mr Storekeeper, and I play the white man's game.  Why do you think I am here?  Simply because I was the only man in  Africa who had the pluck to get to the heart of this business.  I am  here to dish Laputa, and by God I am going to do it.'    I was scarcely prepared for such incredible bluff.  I knew every word  was a lie, but I wanted to hear more, for the man fascinated me.    'I suppose you know what will happen to you,' he said, flicking the  ashes from his cigarette.  'To-morrow at Inanda's Kraal, when the vow  is over, they will give you a taste of Kaffir habits.  Not death, my  friend--that would be simple enough--but a slow death with every  refinement of horror.  You have broken into their sacred places, and  you will be sacrificed to Laputa's god.  I have seen native torture  before, and his own mother would run away shrieking from a man who had  endured it.'    I said nothing, but the thought made my flesh creep.    'Well,' he went on, 'you're in an awkward plight, but I think I can  help you.  What if I can save your life, Mr Storekeeper? You are  trussed up like a fowl, and can do nothing.  I am the only man alive  who can help you.  I am willing to do it, too--on my own terms.'    I did not wait to hear those terms, for I had a shrewd guess what they 
eaten a filling, though not very sustaining, meal, and I thought I  could go on very well till morning.  But I was still badly in arrears  with my sleep, and there was no chance of my snatching a minute till I  was over the Berg.  It was going to be a race against time, and I swore  that I would drive my body to the last ounce of strength.    Moonrise was still an hour or two away, and the sky was bright with  myriad stars.  I knew now what starlight meant, for there was ample  light to pick my way by.  I steered by the Southern Cross, for I was  aware that the Berg ran north and south, and with that constellation on  my left hand I was bound to reach it sooner or later.  The bush closed  around me with its mysterious dull green shades, and trees, which in  the daytime were thin scrub, now loomed like tall timber.  It was very  eerie moving, a tiny fragment of mortality, in that great wide silent  wilderness, with the starry vault, like an impassive celestial  audience, watching with many eyes.  They cheered me, those stars.  In  my hurry and fear and passion they spoke of the old calm dignities of  man.  I felt less alone when I turned my face to the lights which were  slanting alike on this uncanny bush and on the homely streets of  Kirkcaple.    The silence did not last long.  First came the howl of a wolf, to be  answered by others from every quarter of the compass. This serenade  went on for a bit, till the jackals chimed in with their harsh bark.  I  had been caught by darkness before this when hunting on the Berg, but I  was not afraid of wild beasts. That is one terror of the bush which  travellers' tales have put too high.  It was true that I might meet a  hungry lion, but the chance was remote, and I had my pistol.  Once  indeed a huge animal bounded across the road a little in front of me.  For a moment I took him for a lion, but on reflection I was inclined to 
straight job of tackling a man my strength miraculously returned.  It  was even so now.  I lay on my side, luxuriating in being still, and  slowly a sort of vigour crept back into my limbs.  Perhaps a half-hour  of rest was given me before, on the lip of the gully, I saw figures  appear.  Looking down I saw several men who had come across from the  opposite side of the valley, scrambling up the stream.  I got to my  feet, with Colin bristling beside me, and awaited them with the  stiffest face I could muster.    As I expected, they were Machudi's men.  I recognized them by the red  ochre in their hair and their copper-wire necklets. Big fellows they  were, long-legged and deep in the chest, the true breed of  mountaineers.  I admired their light tread on the slippery rock.  It  was hopeless to think of evading such men in their own hills.    The men from the side joined the men in front, and they stood looking  at me from about twelve yards off.  They were armed only with  knobkerries, and very clearly were no part of Laputa's army.  This made  their errand plain to me.    'Halt!' I said in Kaffir, as one of them made a hesitating step to  advance.  'Who are you and what do you seek?'    There was no answer, but they looked at me curiously. Then one made a  motion with his stick.  Colin gave a growl, and would have been on him  if I had not kept a hand on his collar. The rash man drew back, and all  stood stiff and perplexed.    'Keep your hands by your side,' I said, 'or the dog, who has a devil,  will devour you.  One of you speak for the rest and tell me your  purpose.'    For a moment I had a wild notion that they might be friends, some of  Arcoll's scouts, and out to help me.  But the first words shattered the  fancy.    'We are sent by Inkulu,' the biggest of them said.  'He bade us bring  
Would you like to hear something of it by way of preparation?'    In a low gentle voice he began to tell me mysteries of awful cruelty.  At first I scarcely heard him, but as he went on my brain seemed to  wake from its lethargy.  I listened with freezing blood.  Not in my  wildest nightmares had I imagined such a fate.  Then in despite of  myself a cry broke from me.    'It interests you?' Laputa asked.  'I could tell you more, but  something must be left to the fancy.  Yours should be an active one,'  and his hand gripped my shaking wrist and felt my pulse.    'Henriques will see that the truth does not fall short of my forecast,'  he went on.  'For I have appointed Henriques your executioner.'    The name brought my senses back to me.    'Kill me,' I said, 'but for God's sake kill Henriques too.  If you did  justice you would let me go and roast the Portugoose alive.  But for me  the Snake would be over the Lebombo by this time in Henriques' pocket.'    'But it is not, my friend.  It was stolen by a storekeeper, who will  shortly be wishing he had died in his mother's womb.'    My plan was slowly coming back to me.    'If you value Prester John's collar, you will save my life. What will  your rising be without the Snake?  Would they follow you a yard if they  suspected you had lost it?'    'So you would threaten me,' Laputa said very gently.  Then in a burst  of wrath he shouted, 'They will follow me to hell for my own sake.  Imbecile, do you think my power is built on a trinket?  When you are in  your grave, I will be ruling a hundred millions from the proudest  throne on earth.'    He sprang to his feet, and pulled back a shutter of the window, letting  a flood of light into the hut.  In that light I saw that he had in his  hands the ivory box which had contained the collar. 
away under a light west wind over the far plains, so that they were  seen through a haze of opal.    Laputa bade me take the lead.  I saw quite clear the red kloof on the  far side, where the collar was hid.  To get there we might have ridden  straight into the cup, but a providential instinct made me circle round  the top till we were on the lip of the ravine.  This was the road some  of Machudi's men had taken, and unthinkingly I followed them.  Twenty  minutes' riding brought us to the place, and all the while I had no  kind of plan of escape.  I was in the hands of my Maker, watching, like  the Jews of old, for a sign.    Laputa dismounted and looked down into the gorge.    'There is no road there,' I said.  'We must go down to the foot and  come up the stream-side.  It would be better to leave your horse here.'  He started down the cliff, which from above looks a sheer precipice.  Then he seemed to agree with me, took the rope from the _schimmel_'s  neck, and knee-haltered his beast.  And at that moment I had an  inspiration.    With my wrist-rope in his hand, he preceded me down the hill till we  got to the red screes at the foot of the kloof.  Then, under my  guidance, we turned up into the darkness of the gorge.  As we entered I  looked back, and saw figures coming over the edge of the green  cup--Laputa's men, I guessed. What I had to do must be done quickly.    We climbed up the burn, over the succession of little cataracts, till  we came to the flat space of shingle and the long pool where I had been  taken that morning.  The ashes of the fire which Machudi's men had made  were plain on the rock. After that I had to climb a waterfall to get to  the rocky pool where I had bestowed the rubies.    'You must take off this thong,' I said.  'I must climb to get the  collar.  Cover me with a pistol if you like.  I won't be out of sight.' 
man turned and ran out of the tent.    Then I remembered what I wanted to say.  I struggled from the bed and  put my hands on his shoulders.    'Laputa is our side of the highroad.  Cut him off from his men, and  drive him north--north--away up to the Rooirand. Never mind the  Wolkberg and the guns, for they can wait.  I tell you Laputa is the  Rising, and he has the collar.  Without him you can mop up the Kaffirs  at your leisure.  Line the high-road with every man you have, for he  must cross it or perish. Oh, hurry, man, hurry; never mind me.  We're  saved if we can chivy Laputa till morning.  Quick, or I'll have to go  myself.'    The tent emptied, and I lay back on the bed with a dim feeling that my  duty was done and I could rest.  Henceforth the affair was in stronger  hands than mine.  I was so weak that I could not lift my legs up to the  bed, but sprawled half on and half off.    Utter exhaustion defeats sleep.  I was in a fever, and my eyes would  not close.  I lay and drowsed while it seemed to me that the outside  world was full of men and horses.  I heard voices and the sound of  hoofs and the jingle of bridles, but above all I heard the solid tramp  of an army.  The whole earth seemed to be full of war.  Before my mind  was spread the ribbon of the great highway.  I saw it run white through  the meadows of the plateau, then in a dark corkscrew down the glen of  the Letaba, then white again through the vast moonlit bush of the  plains, till the shanties of Wesselsburg rose at the end of it.  It  seemed to me to be less a road than a rampart, built of shining marble,  the Great Wall of Africa.  I saw Laputa come out of the shadows and try  to climb it, and always there was the sound of a rifle-breech clicking,  a summons, and a flight.  I began to take a keen interest in the game. 
placidly at the spot where Henriques had slain the Keeper and I had  stolen the rubies. There was no interest or imagination lingering in my  dull brain.  My nerves had suddenly become things of stolid, untempered  iron.  Each landmark I passed was noted down as one step nearer to my  object.  At Umvelos' I had not the leisure to do more than glance at  the shell which I had built.  I think I had forgotten all about that  night when I lay in the cellar and heard Laputa's plans.  Indeed, my  doings of the past days were all hazy and trivial in my mind.  I only  saw one sight clearly--two men, one tall and black, the other little  and sallow, slowly creeping nearer to the Rooirand, and myself, a  midget on a horse, spurring far behind through the bush on their trail.  I saw the picture as continuously and clearly as if I had been looking  at a scene on the stage.  There was only one change in the setting; the  three figures seemed to be gradually closing together.    I had no exhilaration in my quest.  I do not think I had even much  hope, for something had gone numb and cold in me and killed my youth.  I told myself that treasure-hunting was an enterprise accursed of God,  and that I should most likely die. That Laputa and Henriques would die  I was fully certain. The three of us would leave our bones to bleach  among the diamonds, and in a little the Prester's collar would glow  amid a little heap of human dust.  I was quite convinced of all this,  and quite apathetic.  It really did not matter so long as I came up  with Laputa and Henriques, and settled scores with them.  That mattered  everything in the world, for it was my destiny.    I had no means of knowing how long I took, but it was after midnight  before I passed Umvelos', and ere I got to the Rooirand there was a  fluttering of dawn in the east.  I must have passed east of Arcoll's  men, who were driving the bush towards Majinje's.  I had ridden the 
I must perish miserably by degrees, shut in the heart of a hill, though  my friends were out for rescue.  In place of my former lethargy I was  now in a fever of unrest.    My first care was to explore the way I had come.  I ran down the  passage to the chasm which the slab of stone had spanned. I had been  right in my guess, for the thing was gone.  Laputa was in truth a  Titan, who in the article of death could break down a bridge which  would have taken any three men an hour to shift.  The gorge was about  seven yards wide, too far to risk a jump, and the cliff fell sheer and  smooth to the imprisoned waters two hundred feet below.  There was no  chance of circuiting it, for the wall was as smooth as if it had been  chiselled.  The hand of man had been at work to make the sanctuary  inviolable.    It occurred to me that sooner or later Arcoll would track Laputa to  this place.  He would find the bloodstains in the gully, but the  turnstile would be shut and he would never find the trick of it.  Nor  could he have any kaffirs with him who knew the secret of the Place of  the Snake.  Still if Arcoll knew I was inside he would find some way to  get to me even though he had to dynamite the curtain of rock.  I  shouted, but my voice seemed to be drowned in the roar of the water.  It made but a fresh chord in the wild orchestra, and I gave up hopes in  that direction.    Very dolefully I returned to the cave.  I was about to share the  experience of all treasure-hunters--to be left with jewels galore and  not a bite to sustain life.  The thing was too commonplace to be  endured.  I grew angry, and declined so obvious a fate.  'Ek sal 'n  plan maak,' I told myself in the old Dutchman's words.  I had come  through worse dangers, and a way I should find.  To starve in the cave 
  'So he is dead,' he said at last, half-whispering to himself. 'Well, he  was a king, and died like a king.  Our job now is simple, for there is  none of his breed left in Africa.'    Then I told him of the treasure.    'It belongs to you, Davie,' he said, 'and we must see that you get it.  This is going to be a long war, but if we survive to the end you will  be a rich man.'    'But in the meantime?' I asked.  'Supposing other Kaffirs hear of it,  and come back and make a bridge over the gorge? They may be doing it  now.'    'I'll put a guard on it,' he said, jumping up briskly.  'It's maybe not  a soldier's job, but you've saved this country, Davie, and I'm going to  make sure that you have your reward.'      After that I went with Arcoll to Inanda's Kraal.  I am not going to  tell the story of that performance, for it occupies no less than two  chapters in Mr Upton's book.  He makes one or two blunders, for he  spells my name with an 'o,' and he says we walked out of the camp on  our perilous mission 'with faces white and set as a Crusader's.'  That  is certainly not true, for in the first place nobody saw us go who  could judge how we looked, and in the second place we were both smoking  and feeling quite cheerful.  At home they made a great fuss about it,  and started a newspaper cry about the Victoria Cross, but the danger  was not so terrible after all, and in any case it was nothing to what I  had been through in the past week.    I take credit to myself for suggesting the idea.  By this time we had  the army in the kraal at our mercy.  Laputa not having returned, they  had no plans.  It had been the original intention to start for the  Olifants on the following day, so there was a scanty supply of food.  Besides, there were the makings of a pretty quarrel between Umbooni and
