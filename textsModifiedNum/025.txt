a more terrible creature than that which lay before me now.    *       *       *       *       *    He--or it--was reclining upon the floor, for the reason that he could  not have stood. No room save one with a vaulted ceiling such as the  great council chamber, could offer room enough for this creature to  walk erect.    He was, roughly, a shade better than twice my height, yet I believe he  would have weighed but little more. You have seen rank weeds that have  grown up in the darkness to reach the sun; if you can imagine a man  who had done likewise, you can, perhaps, picture that which I saw  before me.    His legs at the thigh were no larger than my arm, and his arms were  but half the size of my wrist, and jointed twice instead of but once.  He wore a careless garment of some dirty yellow, shaggy hide, and his  skin, revealed on feet and arms and face, was a terrible, bloodless  white; the dead white of a fish's belly. Maggot white. The white of  something that had never known the sun.    The head was small and round, with features that were a caricature of  man's. His ears were huge, and had the power of movement, for they  cocked forward as we entered the room. The nose was not prominently  arched, but the nostrils were wide, and very thin, as was his mouth,  which was faintly tinged with dusky blue, instead of healthy red. At  one time his eyes had been nearly round, and, in proportion, very  large. Now they were but shadowy pockets, mercifully covered by  shrunken, wrinkled lids that twitched but did not lift.    *       *       *       *       *    He moved as we entered, and from a reclining position, propped up on  
another; there would be a swift, muttered response, and silence again.  We were waiting--waiting.    Ten minutes went by. Twenty. Thirty.    Impatiently I paced up and down before the exit, the guards at their  posts, ready to obey any orders instantly.    Forty-five minutes. I walked through the exit; stepped out onto the  cold, hard earth.    I could see, behind me, the shadowy bulk of the _Ertak_. Before me, a  black, shapeless blot against the star-sprinkled sky, was the great  administrative building of the Chisee. And in there, somewhere, was  Anderson Croy. I glanced down at the luminous dial of my watch. Fifty  minutes. In ten minutes more--    "John Hanson!" My name reached me, faintly but clearly, through the  medium of my menore. "This is Croy. Do you understand me?"    "Yes," I replied instantly. "Are you safe?"    "I am safe. All is well. Very well. Will you promise me now to receive  what I am about to send, without interruption?"    "Yes," I replied, thoughtlessly and eagerly. "What is it?"    *       *       *       *       *    "I have had a long conference with the chief or head of the Chisee,"  explained Croy rapidly. "He is very intelligent, and his people are  much further advanced than we thought.    "Through some form of communication, he has learned of the fight with  the weird birds; it seems that they are--or were--the most dreaded of  all the creatures of this dark world. Apparently we got the whole  brood of them, and this chief, whose name, I gather, is Wieschien, or  something like that, is naturally much impressed.    "I have given him a demonstration or two with my atomic pistol and the  flashlight--these people are fairly stricken by a ray of light  directly in the eyes--and we have reached very favorable terms.    "I am to remain here as chief bodyguard and adviser, of which he has  need, for all is not peaceful, I gather, in this kingdom of darkness. 
  "But can't you let me stay, now that I'm here?" urged Larry. "I know  something about boats. I'll serve as a member of the crew--anything."    "Impossible. We have a full complement. You would be more of a  hindrance than a help. Besides, I do not care to have the possible  results of this expedition blared before the public."    "I'll write nothing you do not approve."    "I have no time to edit your writings, young man. My own, will occupy  me sufficiently. So it is useless. You are only wasting your  breath--and mine."    He motioned for his officers to carry out his orders.    But before they could move to do so, in strode a lean, middle-aged  Norwegian Larry sensed must be Captain Petersen himself, and on his  weathered face was an expression of such gravity that it was obvious  to everyone something serious had happened.    *       *       *       *       *    Ignoring Larry, after one brief look of inquiry that was answered by  Professor Stevens, he reported swiftly what he had to say.    While cruising full speed at forty fathoms, with kite-aerial out,  their wireless operator had received a radio warning to turn back.  Answering on its call-length, he had demanded to know the sender and  the reason for the message, but the information had been declined, the  warning merely being repeated.    "Was it a land station or a ship at sea?" asked the professor.    "Evidently the latter," was the reply. "By our radio range-finder, we  determined the position at approximately latitude 27, longitude 65."    "But that, Captain, is in the very area we are headed for."    "And that, Professor, makes it all the more singular."    "But--well, well! This is indeed peculiar! And I had been on the point  of turning back with our impetuous young stowaway. What would you  suggest, sir?"    Captain Petersen meditated, while Larry held his breath.  
  Here their guides paused and waited for the main party.    There followed another conference, whereupon their leader stepped up  again, indicating this time that they were to remove their suits.    At this, Professor Stevens balked.    "It is suicide!" he declared. "The air to which they are accustomed  here is doubtless at many times our own atmospheric pressure."    "But I don't see that there's anything to do about it," said Larry, as  their captors danced about them menacingly. "I for one will take a  chance!"    And before they could stop him, he had pressed the release-valve,  emitting the air from his suit--slowly, at first, then more and more  rapidly, as no ill effects seemed to result.    Finally, flinging off the now deflated suit, he stepped before them in  his ordinary clothes, calling with a smile:    "Come on out, folks--the air's fine!"    *       *       *       *       *    This statement was somewhat of an exaggeration, as the air smelt dank  and bad. But at least it was breathable, as Diane and her father found  when they emerged from their own suits.    They discovered, furthermore, now that their flashlights were no  longer operating, that a faint illumination lit the room, issuing from  a number of small crystal jars suspended from the walls: some sort of  phosphorescence, evidently.    Once again the leader of the curious throng stepped up to them,  beaming now and addressing Professor Stevens in some barbaric tongue,  and, to their amazement, he replied in words approximating its harsh  syllables.    "Why, daddy!" gasped Diane. "How can you talk to him?"    "Simply enough," was the reply. "They speak a language which seems to  be about one-third Basque, mixed oddly with Greek. It merely proves  another hypothesis of mine, namely, that the Atlantean influence  reached eastward to the Pyrenees mountains and the Hellenic peninsula,  as well as to Egypt."    *       *       *       *       * 
reported missing.    What followed then, though Von Ullrich masked it in polite words, was  a story of piracy, until they found by degrees that there was more  gold on the bottom of the ocean than the top; and from this to the  discovery of the sunken empire where he now held reign was but a step.    They had thought at first they were looting only empty temples--but,  finding people there, had easily conquered them, though ruling them,  he admitted, was another matter. As, for instance, yesterday, when the  priests had interfered with his orders and carried his three chief  captives off to sacrifice.    "Where now, but for me, you would be food for their gods!" he ended.  "And if you do not find my hospitality altogether to your liking,  friends, remember that you came uninvited. In fact, if you will  recall, you came despite my explicit warning!"    *       *       *       *       *    But since they were here, he told them, they might be willing to repay  his good turn with another.    Whereupon Von Ullrich launched into his proposal, which was that  Professor Stevens place the _Nereid_ at his disposal for visiting the  depths at the foot of the plateau, where lay the capital of the  empire, he said--a magnificent metropolis known as the City of the Sun  and modeled after the great Atlantean capital, the City of the Golden  Gates, and the depository of a treasure, the greedy German believed,  that was the ransom of the world.    The professor frowned, and for a moment Larry thought he was going to  remind their host that this was not a treasure hunt.    "Why," he asked instead, "do you not use your own submarine for the  purpose?"    "Because for one thing, she will not stand the pressure, nor will our  suits," was the reply. "And for another, she is already laden with  treasure, ready for an--er--forced abdication!" with a sardonic laugh.    
overwhelming longing to at least see her again, even though his pride  forced him to remain unseen.    Now, as he stared glumly at Leah through the palms that effectively  screened his own booth, Gordon heartily regretted that he had ever  come. The sight of Leah's clear fresh beauty merely made him realize  what a fool he had been to let that ridiculous little quarrel come  between them.    Then, with a sudden tingling thrill, Gordon realized that he was not  the only one in the room who was interested in Leah and her escort.    Over in the half-darkened corner booth the eery stranger was staring  at the girl with an intentness that made his weird eyes glow like  miniature pools of shimmering blue-green fire. Again Gordon felt that  vague impression of dread, as though he were in the presence of  something utterly alien to all human experience.    *       *       *       *       *    Gordon turned his gaze back to Leah, then caught his breath sharply in  sudden amaze. The necklace about Leah's throat was beginning to glow  with the same uncanny blue-green light that shone in the stranger's  eyes! Faint, yet unmistakable, the shimmering radiance pulsed from the  necklace in an aura of nameless evil.    And with the coming of that aura of weird light at her throat, a  strange trance was swiftly sweeping over Leah. She sat there now as  rigidly motionless as some exquisite statue of ivory and jet.    Gordon stared at her in stark bewilderment. He knew the history of  Leah's necklace. It was merely an oddity, and nothing more--a freak  piece of costume jewelry made from fragments of an Arizona meteorite.  Leah had worn the necklace a dozen times before, without any trace of  the weird phenomena that were now occurring.    Dancers again thronged the floor to the blaring jazz of the negro  orchestra while Gordon was still trying to force his whirling brain to  a decision. He was certain that Leah was in deadly peril of some kind, 
  The green and blue fire of the tentacle's tips flamed to dazzling  brightness. The paralysis of Gordon's body swept swiftly over his  brain. Black oblivion engulfed him.    *       *       *       *       *    When Gordon again recovered consciousness he found that he was lying  on the floor of what was apparently a narrow hall, near the foot of a  stairway. His hands were lashed tightly behind him, and his feet and  legs were so firmly pinioned together that he could scarcely move.    Beside him lay Leah, also tightly bound. A short distance down the  hall was the closed door of Arlok's work-room, recognizable by the  thin line of red light gleaming beneath it.    Moonlight through a window at the rear of the hall made objects around  Gordon fairly clear. He looked at Leah and saw tears glistening on her  long lashes.    "Oh, Blair, I was afraid you'd never waken again," the girl sobbed. "I  thought that fiend had killed you!" Her voice broke hysterically.    "Steady, darling," Gordon said soothingly. "We simply can't give up  now, you know. If that monstrosity ever opens that accursed Gate of  his our entire world is doomed. There must be some way to stop him.  We've got to find that way and try it--even if it seems only one  forlorn chance in a million."    *       *       *       *       *    Gordon shook his head to clear the numbness still lingering from the  effect of Arlok's tentacle. The Xoranian seemed unable to produce a  paralysis of any great duration with his weird natural weapon.  Accordingly, he had been forced to bind his captives like two trussed  fowls while he returned to his labors.    Lying close together as they were, it was a comparatively easy matter  for them to get their bound hands within reach of each other, but 
"Now that begins to be interesting," the other conceded. His eyes had  lost their sleepy look. "Want me to take it on?"    "Later. Right now. I want you to take this visiting gentleman under  your personal charge. Here is the name and the room and hotel where he  is staying. He is to meet with the Secretary to-night--he knows where.  You will get to him unobserved--absolutely unseen; I can leave that to  you. Take him yourself to his appointment, and take him without a  brass band. But have what men you want tail you and watch out for  spies.... Then, when he is through, bring him back and deliver him  safely to his room. Compray?"    "Right--give me Wilkins and Smeed. I rather think I can get this bird  there and back without being seen, but perhaps they may catch Allah  keeping tabs on us at that." He laughed amusedly as he took the paper  with the name and address.    *       *       *       *       *    A waiter with pencil and order-pad might have been seen some hours  later going as if from the kitchen to the ninth floor of a Washington  hotel. And the same waiter, a few minutes later, was escorting a guest  from a rear service-door to an inconspicuous car parked nearby. The  waiter slipped behind the wheel.    A taxi, whose driver was half asleep, was parked a hundred feet behind  them at the curb. As they drove away and no other sign of life was  seen in the quiet street the driver of the taxi yawned ostentatiously  and decided to seek a new stand. He neglected possible fares until a  man he called Smeed hailed him a block farther on. They followed  slowly after the first car ... and they trailed it again on its return  after some hours.    "Safe as a church," they reported to the driver of the first car.  "We'll swear that nobody was checking up on that trip."    And: "O. K." Delamater reported to his chief the next morning. "Put 
sagging.    "Do you believe--really--he can strike him down--at his desk--from a  distance?"    "I know it." Delamater's fingers played for a moment with three bits  of metal in his pocket. Unconsciously he voiced his thoughts: "Does  the President have nails in his shoes, I wonder?"    "What--what's that?" the Chief demanded.    But Delamater made no reply. He was picturing the President. He would  be seated at his desk, waiting, waiting ... and the bells would be  ringing and whistles blowing from distant shops when the bolt would  strike.... It would flash from his feet ... through the thick rug ...  through the rug.... It would have to ground.    He paid no heed to his Chief's repeated question. He was seeing, not  the rug in the Presidential office, but below it--underneath it--a  heavy pad of rubber.    "If he can be insulated--" he said aloud, and stared unseeingly at his  eagerly listening superiors--"even the telephone cut--no possible  connection with the ground--"    "For God's sake, Del, if you've got an idea--any hope at all! I'm--I'm  up against it, Del."    The operative brought his distant gaze back to the room and the man  across from him. "Yes," he said slowly, thoughtfully, "I've got the  beginning of an idea; I don't see the end of it yet.    "We can cut him off from the ground--the President, I mean--make an  insulated island where he sits. But this devil will get him the  instant he leaves ... unless ... unless...."    "Yes--yes?" The Chief's voice was high-pitched with anxious  impatience; for the first time he was admitting to himself his  complete helplessness in this emergency.    "Unless," said Delamater, as the idea grew and took shape, "unless  that wireless channel works both ways. If it does ... if it does...."    The big man made a gesture of complete incomprehension.    "Wait!" said Robert Delamater, sharply. If ever his sleepy indolence  had misled his Chief, there was none to do so now in the voice that  rang like cold steel. His eyes were slits under the deep-drawn brows,  and his mouth was one straight line. 
youngish man who waved his arms emphatically and approached shouting:    "You had no right to come in here! You must go away at once! You have  damaged property! I will tell the Professor! You must pay for the  damage! You must--"    "Damn!" said Tommy Reames. He had just seen that his radiator was  punctured. A spout of ruddy, rusty water was pouring out on the grass.    The youngish man came up furiously. A pale young man, Tommy noticed. A  young man with bristling, close-cropped hair and horn-rimmed  spectacles before weak-looking eyes. His mouth was very full and very  red, in marked contrast to the pallor of his cheeks.    "Did you not see the sign upon the gate?" he demanded angrily, in  curiously stilted English. "Did you not see that trespassers are  forbidden? You must go away at once! You will be prosecuted! You will  be imprisoned! You--"    Tommy said irritably:    "Are you Von Holtz? My name is Reames. You telegraphed me."    The waving, lanky arms stopped in the middle of an excited gesture.  The weak-looking eyes behind the lenses widened. A pink tongue licked  the too-full, too-red lips.    "Reames? The Herr Reames?" Von Holtz stammered. Then he said  suspiciously, "But you are not--you cannot be the Herr Reames of the  article on dominant coordinates!"    "I don't know why," said Tommy annoyedly. "I'm also the Herr Reames of  several other articles, such as on the mechanics of continua and the  mass and inertia of the tesseract. And I believe the current  _Philosophical Journal_--"    *       *       *       *       *    He surveyed the spouting red stream from the radiator and shrugged  ruefully.    "I wish you'd telephone the village to have somebody come out and fix  my car," he said shortly, "and then tell me if this telegram is a joke  or not."    He pulled out a yellow form and offered it. He had taken an 
"I rushed to the dimensoscope and gazed through it into the fifth  dimension. I saw the globe floating onward through the air, toward  that bank of glossy ferns. I saw it settle and turn over, and then  slowly right itself as it came to rest. The Herr Professor got out of  it. I saw him through the instrument which could look into the  dimension into which he had gone. He waved his hand to me. His  daughter joined him, surveying the strange cosmos in which they were.  The Herr Professor plucked some of the glossy ferns, took photographs,  then got back into the globe.    "I awaited its return to our own world. I saw it rock slightly as he  worked upon the apparatus within. I knew that when it vanished from  the dimensoscope it would have returned to our own universe. But it  remained as before. It did not move. After three hours of anguished  waiting, the Herr Professor came out and made signals to me of  despair. By gestures, because no sound could come through the  dimensoscope itself, he begged me to assist him. And I was helpless!  Made helpless by the Herr Professor's own secrecy! For four days and  nights I have toiled, hoping desperately to discover what the Herr  Professor had hidden from me. At last I thought of you. I telegraphed  to you. If you can assist me...."    "I'm going to try it, of course," said Tommy shortly.    He paced back and forth. He stopped and looked through the brass-tubed  telescope. Giant tree-ferns, unbelievable but real. The steel globe  resting partly overturned upon a bank of glossy ferns. Breast-high,  incredible foliage between the point of vision and that extraordinary  vehicle.    *       *       *       *       *    While Tommy had been talking and listening, while he had been away  from the eyepiece, one or other of the occupants of the globe had  emerged from it. The door was open. But now the girl came bounding  suddenly through the ferns. She called, though it seemed to Tommy that 
safe so far. And I've seen one of the weapons of the Ragged Men in  use. If we can get a couple of automatics and some cartridges to  Denham, he'll be safe until we can repair the big solenoid."    "There was the small catapult," said Von Holtz bitterly, "but it was  dismantled. The Herr Professor saw me examining it, and he dismantled  it. So that I did not learn how to calculate the way of changing the  position--"    *       *       *       *       *    Tommy's eyes rested queerly on Von Holtz for a moment.    "You know how to make the metal required," he said suddenly. "You'd  better get busy making it. Plenty of it. We'll need it."    Von Holtz stared at him, his weak eyes almost frightened.    "You _know_? You know how to combine the right angles?"    "I think so," said Tommy. "I've got to find out if I'm right. Will you  make the metal?"    Von Holtz bit at his too-red lips.    "But Herr Reames!" he said stridently, "I wish to know the equation!  Tell me the method of pointing a body in a fourth or a fifth  direction. It is only fair--"    "Denham didn't tell you," said Tommy.    Von Holtz's arms jerked wildly.    "But I will not make the metal! I insist upon being told the equation!  I insist upon it! I will not make the metal if you do not tell me!"    Smithers was in the laboratory, of course. He had been surveying the  big solenoid-catapult and scratching his chin reflectively. Now he  turned.    *       *       *       *       *    But Tommy took Von Holtz by the shoulders. And Tommy's hands were the  firm and sinewy hands of a sportsman, if his brain did happen to be 
But that was the second day of the work upon our own world, and just  before sunset there was a droning in the earthly sky above the  laboratory, and Tommy ran out, and somebody shot at him from a patch  of woodland a quarter of a mile away from the brick building. Isolated  as Denham's place was, the shot would go unnoticed. The bullet passed  within a few feet of Tommy, but he paid no attention. It was one of  Jacaro's watchers, no doubt, but Jacaro did not want Tommy killed. So  Tommy waited until the plane swooped low--almost to the level of the  laboratory roof--and a thickly padded package thudded to the ground.  He picked it up and darted back into the laboratory as other bullets  came from the patch of woodland.    "Funny," he said dryly to Smithers, inside the laboratory again; "they  don't dare kill me--yet--and Von Holtz doesn't dare leave or refuse to  do what I tell him to do; and yet they expect to lick us."    Smithers growled. Tommy was unpacking the wrapped package. A grim,  blued-steel thing came out of much padding. Boxes tumbled after it.    "Sub-machine gun," said Tommy, "and ammunition. Jacaro and his little  pals will try to get in here when they think we've got the big  solenoid ready for use. They'll try to get it before we can use it.  This will attend to them."    "An' get us in jail," said Smithers calmly, "for forty-'leven years."    "No," said Tommy, and grinned. "We'll be in the fifth dimension. Our  job is to fling through the catapult all the stuff we'll need to make  another catapult to fling us back again."    "It can't be done," said Smithers flatly.    "Maybe not," agreed Tommy, "especially since we ruin all our springs  and one gymbal ring every time we use the thing. But I've got an idea.  I'll want five coils with hollow iron cores, and the whole works  shaped like this, with two holes bored so...."    *       *       *       *       * 
that sight. Because the Ragged Men had turned upon Denham with a  concentrated ferocity, somehow knowing instantly that he was more  nearly akin to the men of the Golden City than to them. But at sight  of Evelyn, her garments rent by the thorns of the forest, her white  body gleaming through the largest tears, they seemed to go mad. And  Tommy's eyes, glazing, saw the look on Denham's face as he realized  that Evelyn had not fled, but had followed him in his desperate and  wholly hopeless effort.    Then the swarming mass of Ragged Men surged over the two of them.  Buried them under reaching, hating, lusting fiends who fought even  among themselves to be first to seize them.    Then there was only madness, and Denham was bound beside the man of  the Golden City, and Evelyn was the center of a fighting group which  was suddenly flung aside by the bearded giant, and the encampment of  the Ragged Men was bedlam. And somehow Tommy knew with a terrible  clarity that a man of the Golden City to torture was bliss  unimaginable to these half-mad enemies of that city. But a woman--    He turned from the instrument, three-quarters out of his head. He  literally did not see Von Holtz gazing furtively in the doorway. His  eyes were fixed and staring. It seemed that his brain would burst.    Then he heard his own voice saying with an altogether unbelievable  steadiness:    "Smithers! They've got Evelyn. Get the sub-machine gun."    *       *       *       *       *    Smithers cried out hoarsely. His face was not quite human, for an  instant. But Tommy was bringing the work bench on which he had  installed his magnetic catapult, close over by the dimensoscope.    "This cannot work," he said in the same incredible calmness. "Not  possibly. It should not work. It will not work. But it has to work!"    He was clamping the catapult to a piece of heavy timber. 
the gold in that. And we've got to get there, Reames, because Jacaro  will surely try to make use of that catapult principle you worked out.  He'll raise the devil; and I think the people of that Golden City  would be worth knowing. No, we're partners. Sooner or later, you'll  know how I feel about what you've done. I'm going to bring Evelyn in  here now."    He vanished. An instant later Tommy heard a voice--a girl's voice. His  heart began to pound. Denham came back into the room and with him was  Evelyn. She smiled warmly upon Tommy, though as his eyes fell blankly  upon the smart sport clothes she was again wearing, she flushed.    "My daughter Evelyn," said Denham. "She wants to thank you."    And Tommy felt a warm soft hand pressing his, and he looked deep into  the eyes of the girl he had never before spoken to, but for whom he  had risked his life, and whom he knew he would love forever. There  were a thousand things crowding to his lips for utterance. He had  watched Evelyn, and he loved her--    "H-how do you do?" said Tommy, lamely. "I'm--awfully glad to meet  you."    But before he was well he learned to talk more sensibly.          [Illustration: _--And the ships, at that touch, fell helplessly down  from the heights._]    The Pirate Planet    PART THREE OF A FOUR-PART NOVEL    _By Charles W. Diffin_    Two fighting Yankees--war-torn Earth's sole representatives on  Venus--set out to spike the greatest gun of all time.      WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE    The attack comes without warning; its reason is unknown. But Venus is  approaching the earth, and flashes from the planet are followed by  terrific explosions that wreak havoc throughout the world. Lieutenant  McGuire and Captain Blake of the U. S.

McGuire and Professor Sykes, an  astronomer of Mount Lawson, are captured. 
blow," he said. He stood silent with half-closed eyes; then: "I have  ordered resistance." And there was genuine sorrow and regret in his  eyes as he looked toward the mountain top.    McGuire's eyes followed the other's gaze to find nothing at first save  the volcanic peak in hard outline upon the background of gold; then  only a shimmer as of heat about the lofty cone. The air above him  quivered, formed to ripples that spread in great circles where the  enemy ships were flashing away.    Swifter than swift aircraft, with a speed that shattered space, they  reached out and touched--and the ships, at that touch, fell helplessly  down from the heights. They turned awkwardly as they fell or dropped  like huge pointed projectiles. And the waters below took them silently  and buried in their depths all trace of what an instant sooner had  been an argosy of the air.    The ripples ceased, again the air was clear and untroubled, but  beneath the golden clouds was no single sign of life.    *       *       *       *       *    The flyer's breathless suspense ended in an explosive gasp. "What a  washout!" he exclaimed, and again he thought only of this as a weapon  to be used for his own ends. "Can we use that on their fleets?" he  asked. "Why, man--they will never conquer the earth; they will never  even make a start."    The tall figure of Djorn turned and looked at him. "The lust to kill!"  he said sadly. "You still have it--though you are fighting for your  own, which is some excuse.    "No, this will not destroy their fleets, for their fleets will not  come here to be destroyed. It will be many centuries before ever again  the aircraft of the reds dare venture near."    "We will build another one and take it where they are--" The voice of  the fighting man was vibrant with sudden hope.    "We were two hundred years building and perfecting this," the other 
anyone who seemed so entirely one with himself as did this lovely girl  from a distant star.    He followed where she went dancing on her way, but not for long could  his mind be led away from the menace he could not forget. And on this  day, as on many days to come, he struggled and racked his brain to  find some way in which he could thwart the enemy and avert or delay  their stroke.    *       *       *       *       *    It was another day, and they were some months on their long journey  away from the earth when an inspiration came. Althora had offered to  help, and he knew well how gladly she would aid him; the feeling  between them had flowered into open, if unspoken love. Not that he  would subject her to any danger--he himself would take all of that  when it came--but meanwhile--    "Althora," he asked her, "can you project your mind into that of one  of the reds?"    "I could, easily," she replied, "but it would not be pleasant. Their  minds are horrible; they reek of evil things." She shuddered at the  thought, but the man persisted.    "But if you could help, would you be willing? I can do so little; I  can never stop them; but I may save my people from some suffering at  least. Here is my idea:    "Djorn tells me that I had it figured right: they plan an invasion of  the earth when next the two planets approach. He has told me of their  armies and their fleets of ships that will set off into space. I can't  prevent it; I am helpless! But if I knew what their leader was  thinking--"    "Torg!" she exclaimed. "You want to know the mind of that beast of  beasts!"    "Yes," said the man. "It might be of value. Particularly if I could  know something of their great gun--where it is and what it is--well, I 
who had learned to respect him in the field of science.    One breathless moment he waited; then--    "Now!" he whispered, and touched the battery's terminals with the bare  wires.    *       *       *       *       *    To McGuire it seemed, in that instant of shattering chaos, that the  great gun itself must have fired. He had known the jar of heavy  artillery at close range; he had had experience with explosives. He  had even been near when a government arsenal had thrown the  countryside into a hell of jarring, ear-splitting pandemonium. But the  concussion that shook the earth under him now was like nothing he had  known.    The hill of sand that sheltered them vanished to sweep in a sheet  above their heads. And the air struck down with terrific weight, then  left them in an airless void that seemed to make their bodies swell  and explode. It rushed back in a whirling gale to sweep showers of  sand and pebbles over the helpless forms of the three who lay battered  and stunned.    An instant that was like an age; then the scientist pointed with a  weak and trembling hand where a towering spire of metallic gray leaned  slowly in the air. So slowly it moved, to the eyes of the watchers--a  great arc of gathering force and speed that shattered the ground where  it struck.    "The gun!" was all that the still-dazed lieutenant could say.  "The--the gun!" And he fell to shivering uncontrollably, while tears  of pure happiness streamed down his face.    The mammoth siege gun--the only weapon for bombardment of the helpless  Earth--was a mass of useless metal, a futile thing that lay twisted  and battered on the sands of the sea.    *       *       *       *       *    The submarine now showed at a distance; it had withdrawn, by 
Dear Editor:    You'll excuse my writing, for it is the end of vacation.    I like your book very much, which many other readers approve of. Some  dislikes, of course, everyone has, and I have three which many readers  have, too. First, I wish the magazine were bigger and the paper  better. Second, have more stories and raise the price to 25c. Third,  have stories of the future such as "Earth, the Marauder," and stories  of lost Atlantis, the fourth dimension, other planets, atoms and  electrons.--Jack Farber, Payette, Idaho.    P. S. I am 11 years old and interested in science.      _Doesn't Like Serials_    Dear Editor:    I am a recent reader of the Astounding Stories magazine. I am going to  keep getting the magazine, as I like it very much.    I did not like "Murder Madness," or Burks' "Earth, the Marauder" very  much. I do not think "Murder Madness" is the type of story that  belongs in this magazine. I do not like continued stories very much as  I hate to break off at an interesting point and wait a whole month  before I can read the next installment or conclusion of the story. The  front piece of the magazine is very good, and except for the  criticisms mentioned above the magazine is excellent.--Kempt Mitchell.      _A Staunch Defender_    Dear Editor:    At one time a friend introduced your excellent little publication to  me. I read it and enjoyed every paragraph of it. This issue starred  "The Monsters of Moyen," which I consider a real super-science story.  I have followed "The Readers' Corner" quite a time.    In the September issue I saw where someone made a commentary on the  magazine. One of the things they said was that the paper should be of  a better grade. It is true that this would help, but "our" magazine is  not half full of advertisements to pay for this expense. Dear friends,  this is no Saturday Evening Post. Don't ask too much. Then, you may  take in consideration that other magazines of Science Fiction have no  better grade of paper than this, for I have purchased several.
