"Once on a Time"    I am going to tell a story, one of those tales of astonishing  adventures that happened years and years and years ago.  Perhaps you  wonder why it is that so many stories are told of "once on a time", and  so few of these days in which we live; but that is easily explained.    In the old days, when the world was young, there were no automobiles  nor flying-machines to make one wonder; nor were there railway trains,  nor telephones, nor mechanical inventions of any sort to keep people  keyed up to a high pitch of excitement.  Men and women lived simply and  quietly.  They were Nature's children, and breathed fresh air into  their lungs instead of smoke and coal gas; and tramped through green  meadows and deep forests instead of riding in street cars; and went to  bed when it grew dark and rose with the sun--which is vastly different  from the present custom.  Having no books to read they told their  adventures to one another and to their little ones; and the stories  were handed down from generation to generation and reverently believed.    Those who peopled the world in the old days, having nothing but their  hands to depend on, were to a certain extent helpless, and so the  fairies were sorry for them and ministered to their wants patiently and  frankly, often showing themselves to those they befriended.    So people knew fairies in those days, my dear, and loved them, together  with all the ryls and knooks and pixies and nymphs and other beings 
 "To be sure!" said Seseley, with sympathy.  "I never thought of fairy  life in that way before.  It must get to be quite tiresome."    "And think of the centuries I must yet live!" exclaimed the fairy in a  dismal voice.  "Isn't it an awful thing to look forward to?"    "It is, indeed," agreed Seseley.    "I'd be glad to exchange lives with you," said Helda, looking at the  fairy with intense admiration.    "But you can't do that," answered the little creature quickly.  "Mortals can't become fairies, you know--although I believe there was  once a mortal who was made immortal."    "But fairies can become anything they desire!" cried Berna.    "Oh, no, they can't.  You are mistaken if you believe that," was the  reply.  "I could change YOU into a fly, or a crocodile, or a bobolink,  if I wanted to; but fairies can't change themselves into anything else."    "How strange!" murmured Seseley, much impressed.    "But YOU can," cried the fairy, jumping up and coming toward them.  "You are mortals, and, by the laws that govern us, a mortal can change  a fairy into anything she pleases."    "Oh!" said Seseley, filled with amazement at the idea.    The fairy fell on her knees before the baron's daughter.  "Please--please, dear Seseley," she pleaded, "change me into a mortal!"        4.  Prince Marvel    It is easy to imagine the astonishment of the three girls at hearing  this strange request.  They gazed in a bewildered fashion upon the  kneeling fairy, and were at first unable to answer one word.  Then  Seseley said--sadly, for she grieved to disappoint the pretty creature:    "We are but mortal children, and have no powers of enchantment at all."    "Ah, that is true, so far as concerns yourselves," replied the fairy,  eagerly; "yet mortals may easily transform fairies into anything they  wish."    "If that is so, why have we never heard of this power before?" asked  Seseley.    "Because fairies, as a rule, are content with their lot, and do not 
  As she ceased speaking the fairy was gone, and a slender youth,  dark-eyed and laughing, was holding her hand in his and kissing it  gratefully.    "I thank you, most lovely maiden," he said, in a pleasant voice, "for  giving me a place in the world of mortals.  I shall ride at once in  search of adventure, but my good sword is ever at your service."    With this he gracefully arose and began to buckle on his magnificent  armor and to fasten the sword to his belt.    Seseley drew a long, sighing breath of amazement at her own powers, and  turning to Berna and Helda she asked:    "Do I see aright?  Is the little fairy really transformed to this  youth?"    "It certainly seems so," returned Helda, who, being unabashed by the  marvels she had beheld, turned to gaze boldly upon the young knight.    "Do you still remember that a moment ago you were a fairy?" she  inquired.    "Yes, indeed," said he, smiling; "and I am really a fairy now, being  but changed in outward form.  But no one must know this save  yourselves, until the year has expired and I resume my true station.  Will you promise to guard my secret?"    "Oh, yes!" they exclaimed, in chorus.  For they were delighted, as any  children might well be, at having so remarkable a secret to keep and  talk over among themselves.    "I must ask one more favor," continued the youth: "that you give me a  name; for in this island I believe all men bear names of some sort, to  distinguish them one from another."    "True," said Seseley, thoughtfully.  "What were you called as a fairy?"    "That does not matter in the least," he answered, hastily.  "I must  have an entirely new name."    "Suppose we call him the Silver Knight," suggested Berna, as she eyed  his glistening armor.    "Oh, no!--that is no name at all!" declared Helda.  "We might better  call him Baron Strongarm."    "I do not like that, either," said the Lady Seseley, "for we do not 
 he had acquired, and freshly transported from the forest glades in  which he had always lived, was fully as much astonished at his deed of  valor as were the robbers themselves; and if he shuddered a little when  looking upon the heap of senseless thieves you must forgive him this  weakness.  For he straightway resolved to steel his heart to such  sights and to be every bit as stern and severe as a mortal knight would  have been.    Throwing down his staff he ran to the cave again, and stepping between  the sword points he approached the pile of casks and held out his arms  to the boy who was perched upon the top.    "The thieves are conquered," he cried.  "Jump down!"    "I won't," said the boy.    "Why not?" inquired the prince.    "Can't you see I'm very miserable?" asked the boy, in return; "don't  you understand that every minute I expect to fall upon those sword  points?"    "But I will catch you," cried the prince.    "I don't want you to catch me," said the boy.  "I want to be miserable.  It's the first chance I've ever had, and I'm enjoying my misery very  much."    This speech so astonished Prince Marvel that for a moment he stood  motionless.  Then he retorted, angrily:    "You're a fool!"    "If I wasn't so miserable up here, I'd come down and thrash you for  that," said the boy, with a sigh.    This answer so greatly annoyed Prince Marvel that he gave the central  cask of the pyramid a sudden push, and the next moment the casks were  tumbling in every direction, while the boy fell headlong in their midst.    But Marvel caught him deftly in his arms, and so saved him from the  sword points.    "There!" he said, standing the boy upon his feet; "now you are released  from your misery."    "And I should be glad to punish you for your interference," declared  the boy, gloomily eying his preserver, "had you not saved my life by  catching me.  According to the code of honor of knighthood I can not 
  "Give it to the poor," said Prince Marvel, promptly.    "What poor?"    "Oh, the poorest people I can find."    "Will you permit me to advise you in this matter?" asked the king of  thieves, politely.    "Yes, indeed; for I am a stranger in this land," returned the prince.    "Well, I know a lot of people who are so poor that they have no  possessions whatever, neither food to eat, houses to live in, nor any  clothing but that which covers their bodies.  They can call no man  friend, nor will any lift a hand to help them.  Indeed, good sir, I  verily believe they will soon perish miserably unless you come to their  assistance!"    "Poor creatures!" exclaimed Prince Marvel, with ready sympathy; "tell  me who they are, and I will divide amongst them all your ill-gotten  gains."    "They are ourselves," replied the king of thieves, with a sigh.    Marvel looked at him in amazement, and then burst into joyous laughter.    "Yourselves!" he cried, greatly amused.    "Indeed, yes!" said Wul-Takim, sadly.  "There are no poorer people in  all the world, for we have ropes about our necks and are soon to be  hanged.  To-morrow we shall not have even our flesh left, for the crows  will pick our bones."    "That is true," remarked Marvel, thoughtfully.  "But, if I restore to  you the treasure, how will it benefit you, since you are about to die?"    "Must you really hang us?" asked the thief.    "Yes; I have decreed it, and you deserve your fate."    "Why?"    "Because you have wickedly taken from helpless people their property,  and committed many other crimes besides."    "But I have reformed!  We have all reformed--have we not, brothers?"    "We have!" answered the other thieves, who, having regained their  senses, were listening to this conversation with much interest.    "And, if you will return to us our treasure, we will promise never to  steal again, but to remain honest men and enjoy our wealth in peace," 
 caught me, stripped off all my fine clothes and jewels and beat me  well.  Then they carried me to their cave, dressed me in rags, and  perched me on the top of the casks, where the slightest movement on my  part would send me tumbling among the sword points.  This was really  delightful, and I was quite happy until you came and released me.    "I thought then that I might gain some pleasure by provoking you to  anger; and our fight was the result.  That blow on the ear was  exquisite, and by forcing me to become your servant you have made me,  for the first time in my life, almost contented.  For I hope in your  company to experience a great many griefs and disappointments."    As Nerle concluded his story Prince Marvel turned to him and grasped  his hand.    "Accept my sympathy!" said he.  "I know exactly how you feel, for my  own life during the past few centuries has not been much different."    "The past few centuries!" gasped Nerle.  "What do you mean?"    At this the prince blushed, seeing he had nearly disclosed his secret.  But he said, quickly:    "Does it not seem centuries when one is unhappy?"    "It does, indeed!" responded Nerle, earnestly.  "But please tell me  your story."    "Not now," said Prince Marvel, with a smile.  "It will please you to  desire in vain to hear a tale I will not tell.  Yet I promise that on  the day we part company I shall inform you who I am."        7.  The Gray Men    The adventurers gave no heed to the path they followed after leaving  the cave of the reformed thieves, but their horses accidentally took  the direction of the foot-hills that led into the wild interior Kingdom  of Spor.  Therefore the travelers, when they had finished their  conversation and begun to look about them, found themselves in a  rugged, mountainous country that was wholly unlike the green plains of  Heg they had left behind.    Now, as I have before said, the most curious and fearful of the island 
  When Prince Marvel, with Nerle marching close behind, entered the great  room, Terribus looked at him sharply a moment, and then bowed.  And  when he bowed the eye upon the top of his head also looked sharply at  the intruders.    Then the king spoke, his voice sounding so sweet and agreeable that it  almost shocked Nerle, who had expected to hear a roar like that from a  wild beast.    "Why are you here?" asked Terribus.    "Partly by chance and partly from curiosity," answered Prince Marvel.  "No one in this island, except your own people, had ever seen the king  of Spor; so, finding myself in your country, I decided to come here and  have a look at you."    The faces of the people who stood about the throne wore frightened  looks at the unheard of boldness of this speech to their terrible  monarch.  But the king merely nodded and inquired:    "Since you have seen me, what do you think of me?"    "I am sorry you asked that question," returned the prince; "for I must  confess you are a very frightful-looking creature, and not at all  agreeable to gaze upon."    "Ha! you are honest, as well as frank," exclaimed the king.  "But that  is the reason I do not leave my kingdom, as you will readily  understand.  And that is the reason I never permit strangers to come  here, under penalty of death.  So long as no one knows the King of Spor  is a monster people will not gossip about my looks, and I am very  sensitive regarding my personal appearance.  You will perhaps  understand that if I could have chosen I should have been born  beautiful instead of ugly."    "I certainly understand that.  And permit me to say I wish you were  beautiful.  I shall probably dream of you for many nights," added the  prince.    "Not for many," said King Terribus, quietly.  "By coming here you have  chosen death, and the dead do not dream."    "Why should I die?" inquired Prince Marvel, curiously.    
 like frightened sheep; and then suddenly the doors flew open and the  Royal Dragon advanced to the center of the room.    This creature was at once the pride and terror of the Kingdom of Spor.  It was more than thirty feet in length and covered everywhere with  large green scales set with diamonds, making the dragon, when it moved,  a very glittering spectacle.  Its eyes were as big as pie-plates, and  its mouth--when wide opened--fully as large as a bath-tub.  Its tail  was very long and ended in a golden ball, such as you see on the top of  flagstaffs.  Its legs, which were as thick as those of an elephant, had  scales which were set with rubies and emeralds.  It had two monstrous,  big ears and two horns of carved ivory, and its teeth were also carved  into various fantastic shapes--such as castles, horses' heads, chinamen  and griffins--so that if any of them broke it would make an excellent  umbrella handle.    The Royal Dragon of Spor came crawling into the throne-room rather  clumsily, groaning and moaning with every step and waving its ears like  two blankets flying from a clothesline.    The king looked on it and frowned.    "Why are you not breathing fire and brimstone?" he demanded, angrily.    "Why, I was caught out in a gale the other night," returned the Dragon,  rubbing the back of its ear with its left front paw, as it paused and  looked at the king, "and the wind put out my fire."    "Then why didn't you light it again?" asked Terribus, turning on the  keepers.    "We--we were out of matches, your Majesty!" stammered the trembling  Gray Men.    "So--ho!" yelled the king, and was about to order the keepers beheaded;  but just then Nerle pulled out his match-box, lit one of the matches,  and held it in front of the Dragon's mouth.  Instantly the creature's  breath caught fire; and it began to breathe flames a yard in length.    "That's better," sighed the Dragon, contentedly.  "I hope your Majesty  is now satisfied."    "No,--I am not satisfied!" declared King Terribus.  "Why do you not 
of Prince Marvel rang loud and clear; for the sight of the puzzled and  terrified faces about him was very comical.  Plucking a dart from the  sack he raised his arm and cried:    "Now it is my turn.  You shall have back your darts!"    "Hold!" shouted the king, in great fear.  "Do not, I beg you, slay my  faithful servants."  And with a wave of his hand he dismissed the  dwarfs, who were glad to rush from the room and escape.    Nerle wiped the tears from his eyes, for he was sorely disappointed at  having again escaped all pain and discomfort; but Prince Marvel seated  himself quietly upon a stool and looked at the scowling face of King  Terribus with real amusement.    The monarch of Spor had never before been so foiled and scorned by any  living creature.  Defeated and humbled before his own people, he bowed  his crimson head on his hands and sullenly regarded his foe with his  top eye.  Then it was that the idea came to him that no ordinary mortal  could have thwarted him so easily, and he began to fear he was  dealing--perhaps unawares--with some great magician or sorcerer.  That  a fairy should have assumed a mortal form he never once considered, for  such a thing was until then unheard of in the Enchanted Island of Yew.  But with the knowledge that he had met his master, whoever he might  prove to be, and that further attempts upon the stranger's life might  lead to his own undoing, King Terribus decided to adopt a new line of  conduct, hoping to accomplish by stratagem what he could not do by  force.  To be sure, there remained his regiment of Giants, the pride of  his kingdom; but Terribus dreaded to meet with another defeat; and he  was not at all sure, after what had happened, that the giants would  succeed in conquering or destroying the strangers.    "After all," he thought, "my only object in killing them was to prevent  their carrying news of my monstrous appearance to the outside world; so  if I can but manage to keep them forever in my kingdom it will answer 
 face.  "It appears the path we chose winds around in a circle, and so  has brought us back to our starting-point.  So we must make the best of  a bad blunder and spend another night with our ugly friend King  Terribus."    They rode forward through the rows of giants to the castle, where the  ever-courteous servants took their horses and escorted them to their  former handsome apartments with every mark of respect.    No one seemed in the least surprised at their speedy return, and this  fact at first puzzled Nerle, and then made him suspicious.    After bathing and dusting their clothing they descended to the banquet  hall, where King Terribus sat upon his gray stone throne and welcomed  them with quiet courtesy.    The sight of the king's crimson skin and deformed face sent a thrill of  repugnance through Prince Marvel, and under the impulse of a sudden  thought he extended his hand toward Terribus and whispered a magic word  which was unheard by any around him.    Nerle did not notice the prince's swift gesture nor the whispered word;  but he was staring straight at Terribus at the time, and he saw with  surprise the eye on the top of the king's head move down toward his  forehead, and the eye in the center of his forehead slide slightly  toward the left, and the elephant-like nose shrink and shorten at the  same time.  Also it seemed to him that the king's skin was not so  crimson in color as before, and that a thin growth of hair had covered  his head.    However, no one else appeared to notice any change--least of all  Terribus--so Nerle seated himself at the table and began to eat.    "It was very kind of you to return so soon to my poor castle," said the  king to Prince Marvel, in his sweet voice.    "We could not help it," laughed the prince, in reply; "for the road  wound right and left until we knew not which way we traveled; and then  it finally circled around again to your castle.  But to-morrow we shall  seek a new path and bid you farewell forever." 
  "To the Kingdom of Auriel, which you desire to visit.  It is not a  straight road, for it winds around the Land of Twi, so it will carry  you a little out of your way."    "What is the Land of Twi?" inquired the prince.    "A small country hidden from the view of all travelers," said Terribus.  "No one has ever yet found a way to enter the land of Twi; yet there is  a rumor that it is ruled by a mighty personage called the High Ki."    "And does the rumor state what the High Ki of Twi is like?"    "No, indeed," returned the king, smiling, "so it will do you no good to  be curious.  And now farewell, and may good luck attend you.  Yet bear  in mind the fact that King Terribus of Spor owes you a mighty debt of  gratitude; and if you ever need my services, you have but to call on  me, and I shall gladly come to your assistance."    "I thank you," said Marvel, "but there is small chance of my needing  help.  Farewell, and may your future life be pleasant and happy!"    With this he sprang to the saddle of his prancing charger and, followed  by Nerle, rode slowly through the stone arch.  The courtiers and ladies  had flocked from the palace to witness their departure, and the giants  and dwarfs and Gray Men were drawn up in long lines to speed the king's  guests.  So it was a brilliant sight that Marvel and Nerle looked back  on; but once they were clear of the arch, the great stone rolled back  into its place, shutting them out completely from the Kingdom of Spor,  with its turreted castle and transformed king.        13.  The Hidden Kingdom of Twi    Knowing that at last they were free to roam according to their desire,  the travelers rode gaily along the paths, taking but scant heed of  their way.    "Our faces are set toward new adventures," remarked the prince.  "Let  us hope they will prove more pleasant than the last." 
 this land."    "Are none of your people single?" asked Prince Marvel.    "Single," returned the men, as if perplexed.  "We don't understand."    "Are you all double?--or are some of you just one?" said the prince,  who found it difficult to put his question plainly.    "What does 'one' mean?" asked the men.  "There is no such word as 'one'  in our language."    "They have no need of such a word," declared Nerle.    "We are only poor laborers," explained the men.  "But over the hills  lie the cities of Twi, where the Ki and the Ki-Ki dwell, and also the  High Ki."    "Ah!" said Marvel, "I've heard of your High Ki.  Who is he?"    The men shook their heads, together and with the same motion.    "We have never seen the glorious High Ki," they answered.  "The sight  of their faces is forbidden.  None but the Ki and the Ki-Ki has seen  the Supreme Rulers and High Ki."    "I'm getting mixed," said Nerle.  "All this about the Ki and the Ki-Ki  and the High Ki makes me dizzy.  Let's go on to the city and explore  it."    "That is a good suggestion," replied the prince.  "Good by, my  friends," he added, addressing the men.    They both bowed, and although they still seemed somewhat frightened  they answered him civilly and in the same words, and closed their doors  at the same time.    So Prince Marvel and Nerle rode up the double path to the hills, and  the two cows became frightened and ran away with the same swinging  step, keeping an exact space apart.  And when they were a safe distance  they both stopped, looked over their right shoulders, and "mooed" at  the same instant.        14.  The Ki and the Ki-Ki    From the tops of the hills the travelers caught their first glimpse of  the wonderful cities of Twi.  Two walls surrounded the cities, and in  the walls were two gates just alike.  Within the inclosures stood many 
  At this command the twin captains bowed again to both pairs of rulers  and led Prince Marvel and Nerle from the room.  Then they were escorted  along the streets to the twin houses of the captains, and here the  officers paused and scratched their left ears with uncertain gestures.    "There being only half of each of you," they said, "we do not know how  to lock each of you in double rooms."    "Oh, let us both occupy the same room," said Prince Marvel.  "We prefer  it."    "Very well," answered the captains; "we must transgress our usual  customs in any event, so you may as well be lodged as you wish."    So Nerle and the prince were thrust into a large and pleasant room of  one of the twin houses, the double doors were locked upon them by twin  soldiers, and they were left to their own thoughts.        15.  The High Ki of Twi    "Tell me, Prince, are we awake or asleep?" asked Nerle, as soon as they  were alone.    "There is no question of our being awake," replied the prince, with a  laugh.  "But what a curious country it is--and what a funny people!"    "We can't call them odd or singular," said the esquire, "for everything  is even in numbers and double in appearance.  It makes me giddy to look  at them, and I keep feeling of myself to make sure there is still only  one of me."    "You are but half a boy!" laughed the prince--"at least so long as you  remain in the Land of Twi."    "I'd like to get out of it in double-quick time," answered Nerle; "and  we should even now be on the other side of the hedge were it not for  that wicked pair of Ki-Ki, who are determined to kill us."    "It is strange," said the prince, thoughtfully, "that the  fierce-looking old Ki should be our friends and the gentle Ki-Ki our  enemies.  How little one can tell from appearances what sort of heart  beats in a person's body!" 
 music.  But the two Ki-Ki frowned angrily, and the two Ki looked at the  boy in surprise, as if wondering at his temerity.    "Who are these strangers?" asked the pretty High Ki, speaking together  as all the twins of Twi did; "and why are they not mates, but only half  of each other?"    "These questions, your Supreme Highnesses," said the blond-haired pair  of Ki-Ki, "we are unable to answer."    "Perhaps, then, the strangers can answer themselves," said the little  maids, smiling first upon the Ki-Ki and then upon the prisoners.    Prince Marvel bowed.    "I am from the great outside world," said he, "and my name is Prince  Marvel.  Until now I have never seen people that live in pairs, and  speak in unison, and act in the same way and think the same thoughts.  My world is much bigger than your world, and in it every person is  proud to think and act for himself.  You say I am only a 'half,' but  that is not so.  I am perfect, without a counterpart; my friend Nerle  is perfect without a counterpart, and it is yourselves who are halved.  For in the Land of Twi no person is complete or perfect without its  other half, and it seems to take two of you to make one man--or one  maid."    The sweet faces of the twin High Ki grew thoughtful at this speech, and  they said:    "Indeed, it may be you are right.  But it is our custom in Twi to do  everything double and to live double." Then, turning to the Ki, they  asked: "Why have you brought these strangers here?"    "To ask your Supreme Highnesses to permit them to return again to the  world from whence they came," answered the Ki, both of them regarding  their supreme rulers earnestly.    But here the Ki-Ki spoke up quickly in their mild voices, saying:    "That is not our idea, your Highnesses.  We, the Ki-Ki of Twi, think it  best the strangers should be put to death.  And we pray your Supreme  Highnesses to favor our wish." 
"Then go over the wall to the cities, at once, and get together all the  soldiers to fight for me and my cause," commanded the girl.    The twin Ki at once left the room, and the High Ki sat down and began  to ask questions of Prince Marvel and Nerle about the big outside world  from whence they came.  Nerle was rather shy and bashful before the  dainty little maiden, whose yellow robe contrasted delightfully with  her pink cheeks and blue eyes and brown flowing locks; but Prince  Marvel did not mind girls at all, so he talked with her freely, and she  in return allowed him to examine the pretty gold crown she wore upon  her brow.    By and by the Ki came back with both faces sad and gloomy.    "Your Highness," they announced, "we have bad news for you.  The other  High Ki, who is wearing a green gown, has been more prompt in action  than yourself.  She and the Ki-Ki have secured the silver steps and  will allow no others to use them; and already they have sent for the  soldiers of the royal armies to come and aid them.  So we are unable to  leave the garden, and presently the army will be here to destroy us."    Then the girl showed her good courage; for she laughed and said:    "Then we must remain here and fight to the last; and if I am unable to  save you, who are my friends, it will be because I can not save myself."    This speech pleased Prince Marvel greatly.  He kissed the little maid's  hand respectfully and said:    "Fear nothing, your Highness.  My friend and I are not so helpless as  you think.  We consider it our privilege to protect and save you,  instead of your saving us; and we are really able to do this in spite  of the other High Ki and her entire army."    So they remained quietly in the palace the rest of that day, and no one  molested them in the least.  In the evening the girl played and sang  for them, and the ancient pair of Ki danced a double-shuffle for their 
 offices of Ki-Ki, which I shall now bestow upon these good captains  here," and she indicated the good-natured officers who had first  captured the prince and Nerle.    The people of Twi eagerly applauded this act, for the captains were  more popular with them than the former Ki-Ki; but the blond ones both  flushed with humiliation and anger, and said:    "The captains fought against you, even as we did."    "Yet the captains only obeyed your orders," returned the High Ki.  "So  I hold them blameless."    "And what is to become of us now?" asked the former Ki-Ki.    "You will belong to the common people, and earn your living playing  tunes for them to dance by," answered the High Ki.  And at this retort  every one laughed, so that the handsome youths turned away with twin  scowls upon their faces and departed amidst the jeers of the crowd.    "Better hang 'em to a tree, little one," shouted Wul-Takim, in his big  voice; "they won't enjoy life much, anyhow."    But the maid shook her pretty head and turned to the prince.    "Will you stay here and help me to rule my kingdom?" she asked.    "I can not do that," replied Prince Marvel, "for I am but a wandering  adventurer and must soon continue my travels.  But I believe you will  be able to rule your people without my help."    "It is not so easy a task," she answered, sighing.  "For I am singular  and my people are all double."    "Well, let us hold a meeting in your palace," said the prince, "and  then we can decide what is best to be done."    So they dismissed the people, who cheered their High Ki  enthusiastically, returning quietly to their daily tasks and the gossip  that was sure to follow such important events as they had witnessed.    The army of King Terribus and the fifty-nine reformed thieves went to  the twin palaces of the Ki and the Ki-Ki and made merry with feasting  and songs to celebrate their conquest.  And the High Ki, followed by 
  "It is a rich and beautiful country, but has fallen under great  misfortunes.  For when the good king died, about two years ago, the  kingdom was seized by a fierce and cruel sorcerer, named Kwytoffle, who  rules the people with great severity, and makes them bring him all  their money and valuable possessions.  So every one is now very poor  and unhappy, and that is a great pity in a country so fair and fertile."    "But why do not the people rebel?" asked Nerle.    "They dare not rebel," answered the farmer, "because they fear the  sorcery of Kwytoffle.  If they do not obey him he threatens to change  them into grasshoppers and June-bugs."    "Has he ever changed any one into a grasshopper or a June-bug?" asked  Prince Marvel.    "No; but the people are too frightened to oppose him, and so he does  not get the opportunity.  And he has an army of fierce soldiers, who  are accustomed to beat the people terribly if they do not carry every  bit of their wealth to the sorcerer.  So there is no choice but to obey  him."    "We certainly ought to hang this wicked creature!" exclaimed Wul-Takim.    "I wish I had brought my Fool-Killer with me," sighed King Terribus;  "for I could have kept him quite busy in this kingdom."    "Can not something be done to rescue these poor people from their sad  fate?" asked the lovely High Ki, anxiously.    "We will make a call upon this Kwytoffle to-morrow," answered Prince  Marvel, "and see what the fellow is like."    "Alas!  Alas!" wailed the good farmer, "you will all become  grasshoppers and June-bugs--every one of you!"    But none of the party seemed to fear that, and having passed the night  comfortably with the farmer they left his house and journeyed on into  the Kingdom of Auriel.    Before noon they came upon the edge of a forest, where a poor man was  chopping logs into firewood.  Seeing Prince Marvel's party approach,  this man ran toward them waving his hands and shouting excitedly:  
 and wide-open mouth.    "I insist," said Prince Marvel, "upon your turning us into grasshoppers  and your soldiers into June-bugs, as you promised.  If you do not, then  I will flog you--as I promised."    "Very well," returned the sorcerer, with a desperate look upon his  face; "I'll go and find the enchantment."    "And we'll go with you," remarked the prince, pleasantly.    So the entire party accompanied Kwytoffle into the house, where they  entered a large room that was in a state of much disorder.    "Let me see," said the sorcerer, rubbing his ears, as if trying to  think; "I wonder if I put them in this cupboard.  You see," he  explained, "no one has ever before dared me to transform him into a  June-bug or grasshopper, so I have almost forgotten where I keep my  book of enchantments.  No, it's not in the cupboard," he continued,  looking there; "but it surely must be in this chest."    It was not in the chest, either, and so the sorcerer continued to look  in all sorts of queer places for his book of enchantments, without  finding it.  Whenever he paused in his search Prince Marvel would say,  sternly:    "Go on!  Find the book!  Hunt it up.  We are all anxious to become  grasshoppers."  And then Kwytoffle would set to work again, although  big drops of perspiration were now streaming down his face.    Finally he pulled an old book from underneath the pillow of his bed,  and crying, "Here it is!" carried it to the window.    He turned a few leaves of the book and then said:    "How unfortunate!  The compound I require to change you into  grasshoppers must be mixed on the first day of September; and as this  is now the eighth day of September I must wait nearly a year before I  can work the enchantment."    "How about the June-bugs?" asked Nerle.    "Oh!  Ah!  The June-bug mixture can only be made at the dark o' the  moon," said the sorcerer, pretending to read, "and that is three weeks 
even to meet him, if it were possible to avoid it.    This same Red Rogue it was who had drawn the good Baron Merd into a  quarrel and afterward slain the old knight and his followers, destroyed  his castle, and carried his little daughter Seseley and her girl  friends, Berna and Helda, into captivity, shutting them up in his own  gloomy castle.    The Red Rogue thought he had done a very clever thing, and had no fear  of the consequences until one of his men came running up to the castle  to announce that Prince Marvel and his companions were approaching to  rescue the Lady Seseley.    "How many of them are there?" demanded the Red Rogue.    "There are eight, altogether," answered the man, "but two of them are  girls."    "And they expect to force me to give up my captives?" asked the Red  One, laughing with a noise like the roar of a waterfall.  "Why, I shall  make prisoners of every one of them!"    The man looked at his master fearfully, and replied:    "This Prince Marvel is very famous, and all people speak of his bravery  and power.  It was he who conquered King Terribus of Spor, and that  mighty ruler is now his friend, and is one of the eight who approach."    The Red Rogue stopped laughing, for the fame of Spor's terrible king  had long ago reached him.  And he reflected that any one who could  conquer the army of giants and dwarfs and Gray Men that served Terribus  must surely be one to be regarded seriously.  Moreover--and this was a  secret--the Red Rogue had never been able to gain the strength to  correspond with his gigantic size, but had ever remained as weak as  when he was a puny boy.  So he was accustomed to rely on his cunning  and on the terror his very presence usually excited to triumph over his  enemies.  And he began to be afraid of this prince.    "You say two of the party are girls?" he asked.    "Yes," said the man, "but also among them are King Terribus himself, 
 them almost at first sight.  But it was Nerle who became the little  lady's staunchest friend; for there was something rather mystical and  unnatural to him about the High Ki, who seemed almost like fairies,  while in Seseley he recognized a hearty, substantial girl of his own  rank in life.    While they stood talking and congratulating one another outside of the  castle, the Red Rogue of Dawna appeared among them.  He had heard the  noise of the smashing of his great mirror, and had come running  downstairs from his hiding-place to find his cunning had all been for  naught and his captives were free.    A furious anger then took possession of the Rogue, and forgetting his  personal weakness he caught up a huge battle-ax and rushed out to hurl  himself upon Prince Marvel, intending to do him serious injury.    But the prince was not taken unawares.  He saw the Red Rogue coming and  met him with drawn sword, striking quickly at the arm that wielded the  big ax.  The stroke was as sure as it was quick, and piercing the arm  of the giant caused him to drop the ax with a howl of pain.    Then Prince Marvel seized the Red Rogue by the ear--which he was just  tall enough to reach--and dragged him up the steps and into the castle,  the big fellow crying for mercy at every step and trembling like a leaf  through cowardice.    But down the hall Marvel marched him, seeking some room where the Rogue  might be safely locked in.  The great curtain that covered the second  enchanted mirror now caught Prince Marvel's eye, and, still holding his  prisoner by the ear, he reached out his left hand and pulled aside the  drapery.    The Red Rogue looked to see what his captor was doing, and beheld his  own reflection in the magic mirror.  Instantly he gave a wild cry and  disappeared, his body becoming absolutely invisible, while his coarse  red countenance stared back from the mirror.    And then Prince Marvel gave a sigh of relief and dropped the curtain  over the surface of the mirror.  For he realized that the Red Rogue of
