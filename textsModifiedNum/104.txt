"I think you've said enough, sir."    Bones was very red and very haughty.    "Far be it from me to resent your attitude or contradict your calumnies.  Miss Hamilton will see very little of me. An inflexible sense of duty  will keep me away from the frivolous circle of society, sir. Alert an'  sleepless----"    "Trenches," said Hamilton brutally.    Bones winced, regarded his superior for a moment with pain, saluted, and  turning on his heel, stalked away, followed by Ali Abid no less pained.    He left at dawn the next morning, and both Sanders and Hamilton came  down to the concrete quay to see the _Zaire_ start on her journey.  Sanders gave his final instructions--    "If the woman is upsetting the people, arrest her; if she has too big a  hold on them, arrest her; but if she is just amusing them, come back."    "And don't forget the 17th," said Hamilton.    "I may arrive a little late for that," said Bones gravely. "I don't  wish to be a skeleton at your jolly old festive board, dear old  sportsman--you will excuse my absence to Miss Hamilton. I shall  probably have a headache and all that sort of thing."    He waved a sad farewell as the _Zaire_ passed round the bend of the  river, and looked, as he desired to look, a melancholy figure with his  huge pipe in his mouth and his hands thrust dejectedly into his trousers  pockets.    Once out of sight he became his own jovial self.    "Lieutenant Ali," he said, "get out my log and put it in old Sanders'  cabin, make me a cup of tea and keep her jolly old head east, east by  north."    "Ay, ay, sir," said Ali in excellent English.    The "log" which Bones kept was one of the secret documents which never  come under the eye of the superior authorities. There were such entries  as--    "Wind N.N.W. Sea calm. Hostile craft sighted on port bow, at 10.31  a.m. General Quarters sounded 10.32. Interrogated Captain of the 
a sister and a subaltern.    The sister's name was Patricia Agatha, the subaltern had been born  Tibbetts, christened Augustus, and named by Hamilton in his arbitrary  way, "Bones."    Whilst sister and subaltern were separated from one another by some  three thousand miles of ocean--as far, in fact, as the Coast is from  Bradlesham Thorpe in the County of Hampshire--Captain Hamilton bore his  responsibilities without displaying a sense of the burden.    When Patricia Hamilton decided on paying a visit to her brother she did  so with his heartiest approval, for he did not realize that in bringing  his two responsibilities face to face he was not only laying the  foundation of serious trouble, but was actually engaged in erecting the  fabric.    Pat Hamilton had come and had been boisterously welcomed by her brother  one white-hot morning, Houssas in undress uniform lining the beach and  gazing solemnly upon Militini's riotous joy. Mr. Commissioner Sanders,  C.M.G., had given her a more formal welcome, for he was a little scared  of women. Bones, as we know, had not been present--which was unfortunate  in more ways than one.    It made matters no easier for the wretched Bones that Miss Hamilton was  an exceedingly lovely lady. Men who live for a long time in native lands  and see little save beautiful figures displayed without art and with  very little adornment, are apt to regard any white woman with regular  features as pretty, when the vision comes to them after a long interval  spent amidst native people. But it needed neither contrast nor  comparison to induce an admiration for Captain Hamilton's sister.    She was of a certain Celtic type, above the medium height, with the  freedom of carriage and gait which is the peculiar possession of her  country-women. Her face was a true oval, and her complexion of that kind  which tans readily but does not freckle.    Eyes and mouth were firm and steadfast; she was made for ready laughter,  yet she was deep enough, and in eyes and mouth alike you read a  tenderness beyond disguise. She had a trinity of admirers: her brother's  admiration was natural and critical; Sanders admired and feared; 
and all that sort of thing, and my sister, who has an awfully keen sense  of humour, would dearly love to see you at the helm of the _Wiggle_, but  as the Commissioner wants to make a holiday, I think it would be best if  you left the steering to one of the boys."    Bones drew himself up stiffly.    "Dear old officer," he said aggrieved, "I cannot think that you wish to  speak disparagingly of my intelligence----"    "Get that silly idea out of your head," said Hamilton. "That is just  what I'm trying to do."    "I'm under your jolly old orders, sir," Bones said with the air of an  early Christian martyr, "and according to Paragraph 156 of King's  Regulations----"    "Don't let us go into that," said Hamilton. "I'm not giving you any  commands, I'm merely making a sensible suggestion. Of course, if you  want to make an ass of yourself----"    "I have never had the slightest inclination that way, cheery old sir,"  said Bones, "and I'm not likely at my time of life to be influenced by  my surroundings."    He saluted again and made his way to the barracks. Bones had a  difficulty in packing his stores. In truth they had all been packed  before he reached the _Wiggle_, and to an unprofessional eye they were  packed very well indeed, but Bones had them turned out and packed _his_  way. When that was done, and it was obvious to the meanest intelligence  that the _Wiggle_ was in terrible danger of capsizing before she  started, the stores were unshipped and rearranged under the directions  of the fuming Hamilton.    When the third packing was completed, the general effect bore a  striking resemblance to the position of the stores as Bones had found  them when he came to the boat. When everybody was ready to start, Bones  remembered that he had forgotten his log-book, and there was another  wait.    "Have you got everything now?" asked Sanders wearily, leaning over the  rail.    "Everything, sir," said Bones, with a salute to his superior, and a  smile to the girl.  
he saying nice things?"    Hamilton looked up at the awning, and cleared his throat.    "Play the game, dear old sir and brother-officer," croaked Bones.    "He said----" began Hamilton.    "Live an' let live," pleaded Bones, all of a twitter. "_Esprit de corps_  an' discretion, jolly old captain."    Hamilton looked at his subordinate steadily.    "He asked to be branded twice in order that you might not be branded  once," he said quietly.    The girl stared at Bones, and her eyes were full of tears.    "Oh, Bones!" she said, with a little catch in her voice, "you ... you  are a sportsman."    "Carry on," said Bones incoherently, and wept a little at the  realization of that magnificent moment.          CHAPTER III    THE MAKER OF STORMS      Everybody knows that water drawn from rivers is very bad water, for the  rivers are the Roads of the Dead, and in the middle of those nights when  the merest rind of a moon shows, and this slither of light and two  watchful stars form a triangle pointing to the earth, the spirits rise  from their graves and walk, "singing deadly songs," towards the lower  star which is the source of all rivers. If you should be--which God  forbid--on one of those lonely island graveyards on such nights you will  see strange sights.    The broken cooking-pots which rest on the mounds and the rent linen  which flutters from little sticks stuck about the graves, grow whole and  new again. The pots are red and hot as they come from the fire, and the  pitiful cloths take on the sheen of youth and fold themselves about  invisible forms. None may see the dead, though it is said that you may  see the babies.    These the wise men have watched playing at the water's edge, crowing and  chuckling in the universal language of their kind, staggering groggily  along the shelving beach with outspread arms balancing their uncertain  steps. On such nights when M'sa beckons the dead world to the source of  
besides, you're not in the navy."    "That doesn't affect the argument," protested Bones, and was rapidly  shedding his equipment in preparation for another discourse, when she  walked on towards Sanders who had come across the square to meet them.    Bones made a dive at the articles he had dropped, and came prancing (no  other word describes his erratic run) up to Sanders.    "I've just been telling Miss Hamilton, sir and Excellency, that nobody  can find things that old Bones--you'll remember, sir, the episode of  your lost pyjama legs. Who found 'em?"    "You did," said Sanders; "they were sent home in your washing. Talking  about finding things, read this."    He handed a telegraph form to the young man, and Bones, peering into the  message until his nose almost touched the paper, read--    "Very urgent. Clear the line. Administration.    "To Sanders, Commission River Territories. Message begins. Belgian  Congo Government reports from Leopoldville, Bacteriological  Expedition carriers raided on edge of your territory by Inner  N'gombi people, all stores looted including case of 20 culture  tubes. Stop. As all these cultures are of virulent diseases,  inoculate Inner N'gombi until intact tubes recovered. Message  ends."    Bones read it twice, and his face took on an appearance which indicated  something between great pain and intense vacancy. It was intended to  convey to the observer the fact that Bones was thinking deeply and  rapidly, and that he had banished from his mind all the frivolities of  life.    "I understand, sir--you wish me to go to the dear old Congo Government  and apologize--I shall be ready in ten minutes."    "What I really want you to do," said Sanders patiently, "is to take the  _Wiggle_ up stream and get that box."    "I quite understand, sir," said Bones, nodding his head. "To-day is the  8th, to-morrow is the 9th--the box shall be in your hands on the 15th by 
  Sanders was entertaining Patricia Hamilton with stories of native feuds,  when the unexpected deputation squatted in the sun before the verandah.    "O Ko-boru," hailed Sanders, "why do you come?"    Ko-boru was all for a long and impressive palaver, but recognized a  certain absence of encouragement in the Commissioner's tone. Therefore  he came straight to the point.    "Now, you are our father and our mother, Sandi," he said, in conclusion,  "and when you speak, all wonders happen. Also you have very beautiful  friends, Militini, who speak a word and set his terrible soldiers moving  like leopards towards a kill, and Tibbetti, the young one who is  innocent and simple. So I say to you, Sandi, that if you speak one word  to Yoka, he will come back to my daughter, his wife."    Sanders stood by the rail of the stoep and looked down upon the  spokesman.    "I hear strange things, Ko-boru," he said quietly. "They tell me stories  of a woman with many lovers and an evil tongue; and once there came to  me Yoka with a wounded head, for this daughter of yours is very quick in  her anger."    "Lord," said the flustered Ko-boru, "such things happen even in love."    "All things happen in love," said Sanders, with a little smile, "and, if  it is to be, Yoka will return. Also, if it is to be, he will not go back  to the woman, and she will be free. This palaver is finished."    "Lord," pleaded Ko-boru, "the woman will do no more angry things. Let  him come back from sunrise to moonset----"    "This palaver is finished," repeated Sanders.    On their way back to Bingini the relatives of Ko-boru made a plot. It  was the first plot that had been hatched in the shadow of headquarters  for twenty years.    "Would it be indiscreet to ask what your visitors wanted?" asked the  girl, as the crestfallen deputation was crossing the square to their  canoe.    "It was a marriage palaver," replied Sanders, with a little grimace,  "and I was being requested to restore a husband to a temperamental lady 
The east had grown pale, there was a murmur from the dark forests on  either bank, the timorous chirping or bad-tempered squawk of a bird, a  faint fragrance of burning gumwood from the fishing villages  established on the river bank, where, in dancing spots of light, the  women were tending their fires.    There is no intermediate stage on the big river between darkness and  broad daylight. The stars go out all at once, and the inky sky which  serves then becomes a delicate blue. The shadows melt deeper and deeper  into the forest, clearly revealing the outlines of the straight-stemmed  trees. There is just this interregnum of pearl greyness, a sort of  hush-light, which lasts whilst a man counts twenty, before the silver  lances of the sun are flashing through the leaves, and the grey veil  which blurs the islands to shapeless blotches in a river of dull silver  is burnt to nothingness, and the islands are living things of vivid  green set in waters of gold.    "The sunrise!" said Bones, and waved his hand to the east with the air  of one who was responsible for the miracle.    The girl sat in a deep wicker chair and breathed in the glory and the  freshness of the scene. Across the broad river, right ahead of the boat,  a flock of parroquets was flying, screeching their raucous chorus. The  sun caught their brilliant plumage, and she saw, as it seemed, a rainbow  in flight.    "Isn't that wonderful?" she whispered.    Bones peered up at the birds, shading his eyes.    "Just like a jolly old patchwork quilt," he said. "What a pity they  can't talk till you teach 'em! They're awful bad eatin', too, though  some fellers say they make a good curry----"    "Oh, look, look!"    The _Wiggle_ was swerving to the southern bank of the river, and two  majestic flamingos standing at the water's edge had arrested the girl's  attention.    "_They're_ bad eatin', too," said the informative Bones. "The flesh is  fishy an' too fat; heron are just the same."    "Haven't you a soul, Bones?" she asked severely.  
"Then," said Sanders, with a twinkle in his eyes, "you must pretend that  you know."    "What is there to do to-day?" asked Hamilton, rolling his serviette.    He addressed himself to Lieutenant Tibbetts, who, to Sanders's intense  annoyance, invariably made elaborate notes of all the Commissioner said.    "Nothin' until this afternoon, sir," said Bones, closing his notebook  briskly, "then we're doin' a little deep-sea fishin'."    The girl made a grimace.    "We didn't catch anything yesterday, Bones," she objected.    "We used the wrong kind of worm," said Bones confidently. "I've found a  new worm nest in the plantation. Jolly little fellers they are, too."    "What are we doing to-day, Bones?" repeated Hamilton ominously.    Bones puckered his brows.    "Deep-sea fishin', dear old officer and comrade," he repeated, "an'  after dinner a little game of tiddly-winks--Bones _v._ jolly old  Hamilton's sister, for the championship of the River an' the Sanders  Cup."    Hamilton breathed deeply, but was patient.    "Your King and your country," he said, "pay you seven and eightpence per  diem----"    "Oh," said Bones, a light dawning, "you mean _work_?"    "Strange, is it not," mused Hamilton, "that we should  consider----Hullo!"    They followed the direction of his eyes.    A white bird was circling groggily above the plantation, as though  uncertain where to alight. There was weariness in the beat of its wings,  in the irregularity of its flight. Bones leapt over the rail of the  verandah and ran towards the square. He slowed down as he came to a  place beneath the bird, and whistled softly.    Bones's whistle was a thing of remarkable sweetness--it was his one  accomplishment, according to Hamilton, and had neither tune nor rhyme.  It was a succession of trills, rising and falling, and presently, after  two hesitating swoops, the bird rested on his outstretched hand. He came  back to the verandah and handed the pigeon to Sanders.    The Commissioner lifted the bird and with gentle fingers removed the  slip of thin paper fastened to its leg by a rubber band.   
They sat chatting for a time, and then the bearded man looked at his  watch.    "To bed, gentlemen," he said gaily. "We leave you, Herr Commissioner, in  good friendship, we trust?"    "Oh, most excellent," said Sanders awkwardly, for he was a poor liar,  and knew that his spies were waiting on the bank to "pick up" these  potential enemies of his.    He watched them go ashore and disappear into the darkness of the forest  path that leads to the village.    The moon was rising over the tall trees, and an expectant gathering of  Akasava notables were waiting for a white spokesman who came not, when  Bosambo and his bodyguard were engaged in lifting three unconscious men  and laying them in a large canoe. He himself paddled the long boat to  midstream, where two currents run swiftly, one to the sea and one to the  Isisi River, which winds for a hundred miles until it joins the Congo.    "Go with God," said Bosambo piously, as he stepped into his own canoe,  and released his hold of the other with its slumbering freight, "for if  your king is so great, he will bring you to your own lands; and if he is  not great, then you are liars. O Abiboo"--he spoke over his shoulder to  the sergeant of Houssas--"tell me, how many of the magic white stones of  Bonesi did you put in their drink?"    "Bosambo, I put four in each, as you told me, and if my lord Tibbetti  misses them, what shall I say?"    "You shall say," said Bosambo, "that this is Sandi's own word--that when  men plan evils they must first sleep. And I think these men will sleep  for a long time. Perhaps they will sleep for ever--all things are with  God."          CHAPTER VI    THE MEDICINE MAN      At the flood season, before the turbulent tributaries of the Isisi River  had been induced to return to their accustomed channels, Sanders came  back to headquarters a very weary man, for he had spent a horrid week in  an endeavour--successful, but none the less nerve-racking--to impress an 
it!"    Sanders pushed the young scientist aside and looked. When he turned his  head, the girl saw his face was white and drawn, and for a moment a  sense of panic overcame her.    "You silly ass," growled the Commissioner, "they aren't trypnosomes! You  haven't cleaned the infernal eyepiece!"    "Not trypnosomes?" said Bones.    "You seem disappointed, Bones," said Hamilton.    "As a man, I'm overjoyed," replied Bones gloomily; "as a scientist, it's  a set-back, dear old officer--a distinct set-back."    The house-warming lasted a much shorter time than the host had intended.  This was largely due to the failure of a very beautiful experiment which  he had projected. In order that the rare and wonderful result at which  he aimed should be achieved, Bones had the hut artificially darkened,  and they sat in a hot and sticky blackness, whilst he knocked over  bottles and swore softly at the instruments his groping hand could not  discover. And the end of the experiment was a large, bad smell.    "The women and children first," said Hamilton, and dived for the door.    They took farewell of Bones at a respectful distance.    Hamilton went across to the Houssa lines, and Sanders walked back to the  Residency with the girl. For a little while they spoke of Bones and his  newest craze, and then suddenly the girl asked--    "You didn't really think there were any of those funny things in my  blood, did you?"    Sanders looked straight ahead.    "I thought--you see, we know--the tryp is a distinct little body, and  anybody who had lived in this part of the world for a time can pick him  out. Bones, of course, knows nothing thoroughly--I should have  remembered that."    She said nothing until they reached the verandah, and she turned to go  to her room.    "It wasn't nice, was it?" she said.    Sanders shook his head.    "It was a taste of hell," he said simply. And she fetched a quick, long  sigh and patted his arm before she realized what she was doing.   
Bones raised a warning hand, and, though the habitat of the wonderful  child could not have been less than half a mile away, lowered his voice.    "He's asleep--fitfully, but asleep. I've told them to call me if he has  a turn for the worse, an' I'm goin' down with a gramophone after dinner,  in case the old fellow wants buckin' up. But now he's asleep, thankin'  you for your great kindness an' sympathy, dear old miss, in the moment  of singular trial."    He took her hand and shook it heartily, tried to say something, and  swallowed hard, then, turning, walked from the verandah in the direction  of his hut.    The girl was smiling, but there were tears in her eyes.    "What a boy!" she said, half to herself.    Sanders nodded.    "Bones is very nice," he said, and she looked at him curiously.    "That is almost eloquent," she said quietly.    "I thought it was rather bald," he replied. "You see, few people really  understand Bones. I thought, the first time I saw him, that he was a  fool. I was wrong. Then I thought he was effeminate. I was wrong again,  for he has played the man whenever he was called upon to do so. Bones  is one of those rare creatures--a man with all the moral equipment of a  good woman."    Her eyes were fixed on his, and for a moment they held. Then hers  dropped quickly, and she flushed ever so slightly.    "I think you have defined the perfect man," she said, turning the leaves  of her book.    The next morning she was admitted to an audience with that paragon of  paragons, Henry Hamilton Bones.    He lived in the largest of the Houssa huts at the far end of the lines,  and had for attendants two native women, for whom Bones had framed the  most stringent and regimental of orders.    The girl paused in the porch of the hut to read the typewritten  regulations which were fastened by drawing-pins to a green baize board.    They were bi-lingual, being in English and in coast Arabic, in which 
race, live apart from us at S'furi-S'foosi, and were we not prosperous  in those days? Now tell us what man you will set over us."    For one moment Sanders was nonplussed. He was rapidly reviewing the  qualifications of all the little chiefs, the headmen, and the fisher  leaders who sat under him, and none fulfilled his requirements.    In that moment of silence an agitated voice whispered in his ear, and  Bones's lean hand clutched his sleeve.    "Sir an' Excellency," breathed Bones, all of a twitter, "don't think I'm  takin' advantage of my position, but it's the chance I've been lookin'  for, sir. You'd do me an awful favour--you see, sir, I've got his career  to consider----"    "What on earth----" began Sanders.    "Henry Hamilton Bones, sir," said Bones tremulously. "You'd set him up  for life, sir. I must think of the child, hang it all! I know I'm a  jolly old rotter to put my spoke in----"    Sanders gently released the frenzied grip of his lieutenant, and faced  the wondering palaver.    "Know all people that this day I give to you as king one whom you shall  call M'songuri, which means in your tongue 'The Young and the Wise,' and  who is called in my tongue N'risu M'ilitani Tibbetti, and this one is a  child and well beloved by my lord Tibbetti, being to him as a son, and  by M'ilitani and by me, Sandi."    He raised his hand in challenge.    "Wa! Whose men are you?" he cried.    "M'songuri!"    The answer came in a deep-throated growl, and the assembly leapt to its  feet.    "Wa! Who rules this land?"    "M'songuri!"    They locked arms and stamped first with the right foot and then with the  left, in token of their acceptance.    "Take your king," said Sanders, "and build him a beautiful hut, and his  spirit shall dwell with you. This palaver is finished."    Bones was speechless all the way down river. At irregular intervals he  would grip Sanders's hand, but he was too full for speech.  
near enough to the B'wigini to resent overmuch discipline. But his  business was with K'sungasa, for the two days' stay which Bones had made  in the village, and all that he had learnt of the old tamer, had been  responsible for his reckless promise to Patricia Hamilton.    He came at a critical moment, for K'sungasa, a thin and knobbly old man,  with dim eyes and an incessant chuckle, was very near his end. He lay  on a fine raised bed, a big yellow-eyed wild cat at his feet, a monkey  or two shivering by the bedside, and a sprawling litter of kittens--to  which the wild cat leapt in a tremble of rage when Bones entered the  hut--crawling in the sunlight which flooded the hut.    "Lord Tibbetti," croaked the old man, "I see you! This is a good time,  for to-morrow I should be dead."    "K'sungasa," said Bones, seating himself gingerly, and looking about for  the snake which was usually coiled round the old man's stool, "that is  foolish talk, for you will see many floods."    "That is fine talk for the river folk," grinned the old man, "but not  for we people of the forest, who never see flood and only little-little  rivers. Now, I tell you, lord, that I am glad to die, because I have  been full of mad thoughts for a long time, but now my mind is clear.  Tell me, master, why you come."    Bones explained his errand, and the old man's eyes brightened.    "Lord, if I could go with you to the forest, I would bring to you many  beautiful leopards by my magic. Now, because I love Sandi, I will do  this for you, so that you shall know how wise and cunning I am."    In the woods about the village was a wild plant, the seeds of which,  when pounded and boiled in an earthen vessel, produced, by a rough  method of distillation, a most pungent liquid. Abid spoke learnedly of  _pimpinella anisum_, and probably he was right.[4]    [Footnote 4: Both anise and star anise (_Illicium anisatum_) are to be  found in the Territories, as also is a small plant which has all the 
Three lateral cuts on either cheek was the mark of the M'gimi--wounds  made, upon the warrior's initiation to the order, with the razor-edged  blade of a killing-spear. They lived apart in three camps to the number  of six thousand men, and for five years from the hour of their  initiation they neither married nor courted. The M'gimi turned their  backs to women, and did not suffer their presence in their camps. And if  any man departed from this austere rule he was taken to the Breaking  Tree, his four limbs were fractured, and he was hoisted to the lower  branches, between which a litter was swung, and his regiment sat beneath  the tree neither eating, drinking nor sleeping until he died. Sometimes  this was a matter of days. As for the woman who had tempted his eye and  his tongue, she was a witness.    Thus the M'gimi preserved their traditions of austerity. They were  famous walkers and jumpers. They threw heavy spears and fought great  sham-fights, and they did every violent exercise save till the ground.    This was the sum and substance of the complaint which had at last come  to a head.    S'gono, the spokesman of The Diggers, was a headman of the inner lands,  and spoke with bitter prejudice, since his own son had been rejected by  the M'gimi captains as being unworthy.    "Shall we men dig and sow for such as these?" he asked. "Now give a  judgment, King! Every moon we must take the best of our fruit and the  finest of our fish. Also so many goats and so much salt, and it is  swallowed up."    "Yet if I send them away," said the king, "how shall I protect this land  against the warriors of the Akasava and the evil men of the swamp? Also  of the Ochori, who are four days' march across good ground?"    "Lord King," said S'gono, "are there no M'gimi amongst us who have  passed from the camp and have their women and their children? May not  these take the spear again? And are not we M'joro folk men? By my life!  I will raise as many spears from The Diggers and captain them with 
had accompanied him on his journey.    "Lord," said S'kobi, "my fine soldiers do not go with you, for I have  seen how wise is Sandi who is my father and my mother."    Bosambo choked, and as was usual in moments of intense emotion, found  refuge in English.    "Dam' nigger!" he said wrathfully, "I bring um army, I feed um, I keep  um proper--you pinch um! Black t'ief! Pig! You bad feller! I speak you  bad for N'poloyani--him fine feller."    "Lord," said the uncomprehending king, "I see that you are like Sandi  for you speak his tongue. He also said 'Dam' very loudly. I think it is  the word white folk say when they are happy."    Bosambo met Bones hurrying to the scene of the fighting, and told his  tale.    "Lord," said he in conclusion, "what was I to do, for you told nothing  of the ways of N'poloyani when his army was stolen from him. Tell me  now, Tibbetti, what this man would have done."    But Bones shook his head severely.    "This I cannot tell you, Bosambo," he said, "for if I do you will tell  others, and my lord N'poloyani will never forgive me."          CHAPTER X    THE WATERS OF MADNESS      Unexpected things happen in the Territories which Mr. Commissioner  Sanders rules. As for example: Bones had gone down to the beach to "take  the mail." This usually meant no more than receiving a mail-bag wildly  flung from a dancing surf-boat. On this occasion Bones was surprised to  discover that the boat had beached and had landed, not only the mail,  but a stranger with his baggage.    He was a clean-shaven, plump man, in spotless white, and he greeted  Bones with a friendly nod. "Morning!" he said. "I've got your mail."    Bones extended his hand and took the bag without evidence of any  particular enthusiasm.    "Sanders about?" asked the stranger.    "Mr. Sanders is in residence, sir," said Bones, ponderously polite.    The other laughed. "Show the way," he said briskly. 
morning, at breakfast, "and find out what Ali Kano is doing--the lazy  beggar should have reported."    "Any news from the N'gombi?" asked Hamilton.    "Only roundabout stories of their industry. Apparently the sugar  merchant is making big experiments. He has set half the people digging  roots for him. Be ready to sail at dawn."    "Will it be a dangerous trip?" asked the girl.    "No. Why?" smiled Sanders.    "Because I'd like to go. Oh, please, don't look so glum! Bones is  awfully good to me."    "Better than a jolly old brother," murmured Bones.    "H'm!" Sanders shook his head, and she appealed to her brother.    "Please!"    "I wouldn't mind your going," said Hamilton, "if only to look after  Bones."    "S-sh!" said Bones reproachfully.    "If you're keen on it, I don't see why you shouldn't--if you had a  chaperon."    "A chaperon!" sneered Bones. "Great Heavens! Do, old skipper, pull  yourself together. Open the jolly old window and give him air. Feelin'  better, sir?"    "A chaperon! How absurd!" cried the girl indignantly. "I'm old enough to  be Bones's mother! I'm nearly twenty--well, I'm older than Bones, and  I'm ever so much more capable of looking after myself."    The end of it was that she went, with her Kano maid and with the wife of  Abiboo to cook for her. And in two days they came to the bend of the  river, and Bones pursued his inquiries for the missing spy, but without  success.    "But this I tell you, lord," said the little chief who acted as  Sanders's agent, "that there are strange things happening in the N'gombi  country, for all the people have gone mad, and are digging up their  teeth (tusks) and bringing them to a white man."    "This shall go to Sandi," said Bones, realizing the importance of the  news; and that same evening he turned the bow of the _Zaire_ down  stream.    *       *       *       *       * 
rifles.    To-day the N'gombi point to a mound near the village of Fimini, which  they call by a name which means, "The Waters of Madness," and it is  believed to be haunted by devils.          CHAPTER XI    EYE TO EYE      "Bones," said Captain Hamilton, in despair, "you will never be a  Napoleon."    "Dear old sir and brother-officer," said Lieutenant Tibbetts, "you are a  jolly old pessimist."    Bones was by way of being examined in subjects C and D, for promotion to  captaincy, and Hamilton was the examining officer. By all the rules and  laws and strict regulations which govern military examinations, Bones  had not only failed, but he had seriously jeopardized his right to his  lieutenancy, if every man had his due.    "Now, let me put this," said Hamilton. "Suppose you were in charge of a  company of men, and you were attacked on three sides, and you had a  river behind you on the fourth side, and you found things were going  very hard against you. What would you do?"    "Dear old sir," said Bones thoughtfully, and screwing his face into all  manner of contortions in his effort to secure the right answer, "I  should go and wet my heated brow in the purling brook, then I'd take  counsel with myself."    "You'd lose," said Hamilton, with a groan. "That's the last person in  the world you should go to for advice, Bones. Suppose," he said, in a  last desperate effort to awaken a gleam of military intelligence in his  subordinate's mind, "suppose you were trekking through the forest with a  hundred rifles, and you found your way barred by a thousand armed men.  What would you do?"    "Go back," said Bones, "and jolly quick, dear old fellow."    "Go back? What would you go back for?" asked the other, in astonishment.    "To make my will," said Bones firmly, "and to write a few letters to  dear old friends in the far homeland. I have friends, Ham," he said,  with dignity, "jolly old people who listen for my footsteps, and to whom 
"I heard your voice," he said apologetically. "What is the trouble?"    Briefly Sanders related the story the man had told.    "Wow!" said Hamilton, in a paroxysm of delight.    "What's wrong?"    "Bones!" shouted Hamilton. "Bones is the fellow. Let him go up and  subdue her with his eye. He's the very fellow. I'll go over and call  him, sir."    He hustled into his clothing, slipped on a mackintosh, and, making his  way across the dark square, admitted himself to the sleeping-hut of  Lieutenant Tibbetts. By the light of his electric torch he discovered  the slumberer. Bones lay on his back, his large mouth wide open, one  thin leg thrust out from the covers, and he was making strange noises.  Hamilton found the lamp and lit it, then he proceeded to the  heart-breaking task of waking his subordinate. "Up, you lazy devil!" he  shouted, shaking Bones by the shoulder.    Bones opened his eyes and blinked rapidly. "On the word 'One!'" he said  hoarsely, "carry the left foot ten inches to the left front, at the same  time bringing the rifle to a horizontal position at the right side.  One!"    "Wake up, wake up, Bones!"    Bones made a wailing noise. It was the noise of a mother panther who has  returned to her lair to discover that her offspring have been eaten by  wild pigs. "Whar-r-ow-ow!" he said, and turned over on his right side.    Hamilton pocketed his torch, and, lifting Bones bodily from the bed, let  him fall with a thud.    Bones scrambled up, staring. "Gentlemen of the jury," he said, "I stand  before you a ruined man. Drink has been my downfall, as the dear old  judge remarked. I _did_ kill Wilfred Morgan, and I plead the unwritten  law." He saluted stiffly, collapsed on to his pillow, and fell instantly  into a deep child-like sleep.    Hamilton groaned. He had had occasion to wake Bones from his beauty  sleep before, but he had never been as bad as this. He took a soda  siphon from the little sideboard and depressed the lever, holding the  outlet above his victim's head. 
M'fusi business, and I can't think why the Government sent him. They are  a pretty bad lot--their territory is at the back of the Akasava, and the  Chief of the M'fusi is a rascal."    "But he says that he has been sent to reform them," said the girl.    Sanders smiled.    "It is not a job I should care to undertake--and yet----"    He knitted his forehead.    "And yet----?"    "I could reform them--Bones could reform them. But if they were reformed  it would break Bonaventura, for he holds his job subject to their  infamy."    At lunch Sanders was unusually silent, a silence which was unnoticed,  save by the girl. Bones and his friend, however, needed no stimulation.  Lunch was an almost deafening meal, and when the time came for the duc  to leave, the whole party went down to the beach to see him embark.    "Good-bye, old Mug!" roared Bones, as the boat pulled away. "Whoop! hi!  how!"    "You're a noisy devil," said Hamilton, admiringly.    "Vox populi, vox Dei," said Bones.    He had an unexpected visitor that evening, for whilst he was dressing  for dinner, Sanders came into his hut--an unusual happening.    What Sanders had to say may not be related since it was quite  unofficial, but Bones came to dinner that night and behaved with such  decorum and preserved a mien so grave, that Hamilton thought he was ill.    The duc continued his journey down the African Coast and presently came  to a port which was little more than a beach, a jetty, a big white  house, and by far the most imposing end of the Moanda road. In due time,  he arrived by the worst track in the world (he was six days on the  journey) at Moanda itself, and came into the presence of the Governor.    Did the duc but know it, his Excellency had also been prepared for the  young man's mission. The mail had arrived by carrier the day before the  duc put in his appearance, and Pinto Bonaventura had his little piece  all ready to say.
