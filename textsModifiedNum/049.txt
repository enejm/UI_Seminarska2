THE SIXTH BENCH          [Illustration]    _The Personal Conductor:_ "It is a statue of no importance  whatever."    _The Personally Conducted:_ "Yes, but what does it mean?"    _The Personal Conductor:_ "I don't suppose it means anything in  particular. It is not by any well-known artist and the guidebooks say  nothing about it."    _The Personally Conducted:_ "Perhaps the sculptor intended to  typify life; the tragic face representing one side of existence and the  comic mask another."    _The Personal Conductor:_ "Very likely. This way to the Louvre, if  you please."          THE WOMAN OF STONE.      Lurine, was pretty, _petite_, and eighteen. She had a nice  situation at the Pharmacie de Siam, in the Rue St. Honor√©. She had no  one dependent upon her, and all the money she earned was her own. Her  dress was of cheap material perhaps, but it was cut and fitted with  that daintiness of perfection which seems to be the natural gift of the  Parisienne, so that one never thought of the cheapness, but admired  only the effect, which was charming. She was book-keeper and general  assistant at the Pharmacie, and had a little room of her own across the  Seine, in the Rue de Lille. She crossed the river twice every day--once  in the morning when the sun was shining, and again at night when the  radiant lights along the river's bank glittered like jewels in a long  necklace. She had her little walk through the Gardens of the Tuileries  every morning after crossing the Pont Royal, but she did not return 
  "But how was I to get the news?" asked Simkins, with some indignation.  The editor shrugged his shoulders. That was not his part of the  business; and if the Anarchists chose to make things uncomfortable for  the young man, he could not help it.    Simkins' fellow-lodger, a student who was studying chemistry in London,  noticed that the reporter was becoming gaunt with anxiety.    "Simkins," said Sedlitz to him one morning, "you are haggard and  careworn: what is the matter with you? Are you in love, or is it merely  debt that is bothering you?"    "Neither," replied Simkins.    "Then cheer up," said Sedlitz. "If one or the other is not interfering  with you, anything else is easily remedied."    "I am not so sure of that," rejoined Simkins; and then he sat down and  told his friend just what was troubling him.    "Ah," said Sedlitz, "that accounts for it. There has been an unkempt  ruffian marching up and down watching this house. They are on your  track, Simkins, my boy, and when they discover that you are a reporter,  and therefore necessarily a traitor, you will be nabbed some dark  night."    "Well, that's encouraging," said Simkins, with his head in his hands.    "Are these Anarchists brave men, and would they risk their lives in any  undertaking?" asked Sedlitz.    "Oh, I don't know. They talk enough, but I don't know what they would  do. They are quite capable, though, of tripping me up in a dark lane."    "Look here," said Sedlitz, "suppose you let me try a plan. Let me give  them a lecture on the Chemistry of Anarchy. It's a fascinating  subject."    "What good would that do?"    "Oh, wait till you have heard the lecture. If I don't make the hair of  some of them stand on end, they are braver men than I take them to be.  We have a large room in Clement's Inn, where we students meet to try  experiments and smoke tobacco. It is half club, and half a lecture-  room. Now, I propose to get those Anarchists in there, lock the doors, 
the purport of the words startled him.    "Let us be thankful. He is undoubtedly dead." This was said in a tone  of infinite satisfaction.    There seemed to be a murmur of pleasure at the announcement from those  who were with the speaker. Stanford slowly opened his eyes, wondering  what these savages were who rejoiced in the death of an inoffensive  stranger cast upon their shores. He saw a group standing around him,  but his attention speedily became concentrated on one face. The owner  of it, he judged, was not more than nineteen years of age, and the  face--at least so it seemed to Stanford at the time--was the most  beautiful he had ever beheld. There was an expression of sweet gladness  upon it until her eyes met his, then the joy faded from the face, and a  look of dismay took its place. The girl seemed to catch her breath in  fear, and tears filled her eyes.    "Oh," she cried, "he is going to live."    She covered her face with her hands, and sobbed.    Stanford closed his eyes wearily. "I am evidently insane," he said to  himself. Then, losing faith in the reality of things, he lost  consciousness as well, and when his senses came to him again he found  himself lying on a bed in a clean but scantily furnished room. Through  an open window came the roar of the sea, and the thunderous boom of the  falling waves brought to his mind the experiences through which he had  passed. The wreck and the struggle with the waves he knew to be real,  but the episode on the beach he now believed to have been but a vision  resulting from his condition.    A door opened noiselessly, and, before he knew of anyone's entrance, a  placid-faced nurse stood by his bed and asked him how he was.    "I don't know. I am at least alive."    The nurse sighed, and cast down her eyes. Her lips moved, but she said  nothing. Stanford looked at her curiously. A fear crept over him that  he was hopelessly crippled for life, and that death was considered  preferable to a maimed existence. He felt wearied, though not in pain, 
  "Nothing else. It's all right. It's none of my business, of course."    "What is none of your business?"    "Who are you."    "Oh, there's no secret about that. I am a Russian. My name is Katzoff.  At least, these are the first and last syllables of my name. I never  use my full name when I travel; it is too complicated."    "Thanks. And how do you account for your perfect English? Educated in  England, I presume? Baumgarten was."    "No, I was not. You know we Russians are reputed to be good linguists."    "Yes, I had forgotten that. We will now return to the point from which  we started. The band is excellent, and it is about to play one of four  favorite selections, Mr. Katzburg."    "Katzoff is the name. As to the selection, I don't know much about  music, although I am fond of popular pieces."    Katzoff and I got along very nicely, although I did not seem to like  him as well as either Johnson or Baumgarten. He left for Salzburg  without bidding me good-bye. Missing him one day, I called at the  Angleterre, and the porter told me he had gone.    Next day I searched for him, wondering in what garb I should find him.  I passed him twice as he sat on the bench, before I was sure enough to  accost him. The sacrifice of his moustache had made a remarkable  difference. His clean-shaven face caused him to look at least ten years  younger. He wore a tall silk hat, and a long black morning coat. I  found myself hardly able to withdraw my eyes from the white spats that  partially covered his polished boots. He was reading an English paper,  and did not observe my scrutiny. I approached him.    "Well, Johnson," I said, "this _is_ a lay out. You're English this  time, I suppose?"    The man looked up in evident surprise. Fumbling around the front of his  waistcoat for a moment, he found a black silk string, which he pulled,  bringing to his hand a little round disc of glass. This he stuck in one 
get work there probably more easily than in the city. Here are ten  shillings to help you."    "I don't want your money," said Morris, in a surly tone. "I want work."    "I have no work to give you, so I offer you what I have. I haven't as  much of that as I could wish. You are a fool not to take what the gods  send."    Morris, without replying, gathered up his son in his arms and departed.    "Here is a bottle of tonic for him." said the doctor to Mrs. Morris.    He placed the half-sovereign on the bottle as he passed it to her. She  silently thanked him with her wet eyes, hoping that a time would come  when she could repay the money. The doctor had experience enough to  know that they were not to be classed among his usual visitors. He was  not in the habit of indiscriminately bestowing gold coins.    It was a dreary journey, and they were a long time shaking off the  octopus-like tentacles of the great city, that reached further and  further into he country each year, as if it lived on consuming the  green fields. Morris walked ahead with the boy on his back, and his  wife followed. Neither spoke, and the sick lad did not complain. As  they were nearing a village, the boy's head sunk on his father's  shoulder. The mother quickened her pace, and came up to them stroking  the head of her sleeping son. Suddenly, she uttered a smothered cry and  took the boy in her arms.    "What's the matter?" asked Morris, turning round.    She did not answer, but sat by the roadside with the boy on her lap,  swaying her body to and fro over him, moaning as she did so. Morris  needed no answer. He stood on the road with hardening face, and looked  down on his wife and child without speaking.    The kindly villagers arranged the little funeral, and when it was over  Jack Morris and his wife stood again on the road.    "Jack, dear," she pleaded, "don't go back to that horrible place. We  
"You addressed that to me the second time, Mr. Denham."    There was a look of haggard anxiety about Denham that gave color to her  suspicions. He felt that it was now or never.    "Then why don't you answer it, Miss Gale?" he said gruffly.    She backed away from him.    "Answer it?" she repeated faintly.    "Certainly. If I got a letter twice, I would answer it."    "What do you mean?" she cried, with her hand on the door-knob.    "Exactly what the letter says. I want you for my partner. I want to  marry you, and d--n financial considerations----"    "Oh!" cried Miss Gale, in a long-drawn, quivering sigh. She was  doubtless shocked at the word he had used, and fled to her typewriting  room, closing the door behind her.    Richard Denham paced up and down the floor for a few moments, then  rapped lightly at her door, but there was no response. He put on his  hat and went out into the street. After a long and aimless walk, he  found himself again at his place of business. When he went in, Rogers  said to him:    "Miss Gale has left, sir."    "Has she?"    "Yes, and she has given notice. Says she is not coming back, sir."    "Very well."    He went into his own room and found a letter marked "personal" on his  desk. He tore it open, and read in neatly type-written characters:      "I have resigned my place as typewriter girl, having been offered a  better situation. I am offered a partnership in the house of Richard  Denham. I have decided to accept the position, not so much on account  of its financial attractions, as because I shall be glad, on a friendly  basis, to be associated with the gentleman I have named. Why did you  put me to all that worry writing that idiotic letter, when a few words  would have saved ever so much bother? You evidently _need_ a  partner. My mother will be pleased to meet you any time you call. You  have the address,--Your friend, 
we got out into better air. In a surly manner he agreed to this and  started the train, but he did not play fair. Each time he refused to  give up the machine until I was in a fainting condition with holding in  my breath, and, finally, he felled me to the floor of the cab. I  imagine that the machine rolled off the train as I fell and that he  jumped after it. The remarkable thing is that neither of us needed the  machine, for I remember that just after we started I noticed through  the open iron door that the engine fire suddenly became aglow again,  although at the time I was in too great a state of bewilderment and  horror to understand what it meant. A western gale had sprung up--an  hour too late. Even before we left Cannon Street those who still  survived were comparatively safe, for one hundred and sixty-seven  persons were rescued from that fearful heap of dead on the platforms,  although many died within a day or two after, and others never  recovered their reason. When I regained my senses after the blow dealt  by the engineer, I found myself alone, and the train speeding across  the Thames near Kew. I tried to stop the engine, but did not succeed.  However, in experimenting, I managed to turn on the air brake, which in  some degree checked the train, and lessened the impact when the crash  came at Richmond terminus. I sprang off on the platform before the  engine reached the terminal buffers, and saw passing me like a  nightmare the ghastly trainload of the dead. Most of the doors were  swinging open, and every compartment was jammed full, although, as I  afterwards learned, at each curve of the permanent way, or extra lurch  of the train, bodies had fallen out all along the line. The smash at  Richmond made no difference to the passengers. Besides myself, only two  persons were taken alive from the train, and one of these, his clothes  torn from his back in the struggle was sent to an asylum, where he was  never able to tell who he was; neither, as far as I know, did anyone  ever claim him. 
as a President of his country had once remarked. The irksomeness and  restraint of his position began to wear on his nerves, and he cried  aloud for something--anything--to happen rather than what he was  enduring.    Something happened.    From between the Islands, there slowly appeared a great modern French  ship of war, small in the distance. Hope lighted up the face of De  Plonville. She must pass near enough to enable his signalling to be  seen by the lookout. Heavens! how leisurely she moved! Then a second  war vessel followed the first into view, and finally a third. The three  came slowly along in stately procession. De Plonville removed his coat  and waved it up and down to attract attention. So intent was he upon  this that he nearly lost his footing, and, realizing that the men-of-  war were still too far away, he desisted. He sat down as his excitement  abated, and watched their quiet approach. Once it seemed to him they  had stopped, and he leaned forward, shading his eyes with his hand, and  watched them eagerly. They were just moving--that was all.    Suddenly, from the black side of the foremost battle-ship, there rolled  upward a cloud of white smoke, obscuring the funnels and the rigging,  thinning out into the blue sky over the top-masts. After what seemed a  long interval the low, dull roar of a cannon reached him, followed by  the echo from the high hills of the island, and later by the fainter  re-echo from the mountains on the mainland. This depressed De  Plonville, for, if the ships were out for practice, the obscuring smoke  around them would make the seeing of his signalling very improbable;  and then that portion of the fleet might return the way it came,  leaving him in his predicament. From the second ironclad arose a  similar cloud, and this time far to his left there spurted up from the  sea a jet of water, waving in the air like a plume for a moment, then  dropping back in a shower on the ruffled surface.    The buoy was a target!    As De Plonville realized its use, he felt that uncomfortable creeping 
wiped it thoroughly with a cloth he had with him, and threw the cloth  into one of the deserted houses.    They waited near, until the spots caused by the fluid on the stone  pavement in front of the house had disappeared.    "By the time we reach the hill," said Lambelle, "it will be quite dry  in this hot sun."    As they departed towards the elevation, the forlorn dog howled  mournfully, as if in premonition of his fate.    "I think, to make sure," said the inventor, when they reached the  electrical apparatus, "that we might wait for half an hour."    The Minister lit a cigarette, and smoked silently, a strange battle  going on in his mind. He found himself believing in the extraordinary  claims made by the inventor, and his thought dwelt on the awful  possibilities of such an explosive.    "Will you press the electric lever?" asked Lambelle quietly. "Remember  that you are inaugurating a new era."    The Minister pressed down the key, and then, putting his field-glass to  his eye, he saw that the dog was released, but the animal sat there  scratching its ear with its paw. Then, realizing that it was loose, it  sniffed for a moment at the chain. Finally, it threw up its head and  barked, although the distance was too great for them to hear any sound.  The dog started in the direction the two men had gone, but, before it  had taken three steps, the Minister was appalled to see the buildings  suddenly crumble into dust, and a few moments later the thunder of the  rocks falling into the deserted quarry came toward them. The whole  ledge had been flung forwards into the chasm. There was no smoke, but a  haze of dust hovered over the spot.    "My God!" cried the Minister. "That is awful!"    "Yes," said Lambelle quietly; "I put more of the substance on the  flagging than I need to have done. A few drops would have answered  quite as well, but I wanted to make sure. You were very sceptical, you  know."    The Minister looked at him. "I beg of you, M. Lambelle, never to 
full particulars early enough for the first edition. There is no sense  in taking up much time over so simple an affair as the Pegram case.  Good afternoon, sir."    Mr. Scribbings was too much astonished to return the greeting. He left  in a speechless condition, and I saw him go up the street with his hat  still in his hand.    Sherlaw Kombs relapsed into his old lounging attitude, with his hands  clasped behind his head. The smoke came from his lips in quick puffs at  first, then at longer intervals. I saw he was coming to a conclusion,  so I said nothing.    Finally he spoke in his most dreamy manner. "I do not wish to seem to  be rushing things at all, Whatson, but I am going out to-night on the  Scotch Express. Would you care to accompany me?"    "Bless me!" I cried, glancing at the clock, "you haven't time, it is  after five now."    "Ample time, Whatson--ample," he murmured, without changing his  position. "I give myself a minute and a half to change slippers and  dressing gown for boots and coat, three seconds for hat, twenty-five  seconds to the street, forty-two seconds waiting for a hansom, and then  seven at the terminus before the express starts. I shall be glad of  your company."    I was only too happy to have the privilege of going with him. It was  most interesting to watch the workings of so inscrutable a mind. As we  drove under the lofty iron roof of the terminus I noticed a look of  annoyance pass over his face.    "We are fifteen seconds ahead of our time," he remarked, looking at the  big clock. "I dislike having a miscalculation of that sort occur."    The great Scotch Express stood ready for its long journey. The  detective tapped one of the guards on the shoulder.    "You have heard of the so-called Pegram mystery, I presume?"    "Certainly, sir. It happened on this very train, sir."    "Really? Is the same carriage still on the train?"    "Well, yes, sir, it is," replied the guard, lowering his voice, "but of 
"Of course I took it," she said, "why shouldn't I?"    "Great Heavens!" gasped Robbins, and without a word he turned and fled,  leaving the Nice Girl transfixed with astonishment and staring after  him with a frown on her pretty brow.    "What does he mean by such conduct?" she asked herself. But Robbins  disappeared from the gathering throng in the large room of the hotel,  dashed down the steps, and hurried along the narrow pavements toward  the "Golden Dragon." The proprietor was standing in the hallway with  his hands behind him, a usual attitude with the Dragon.    "Where," gasped Robbins, "is Mr.--Mr.----" and then he remembered he  didn't know the name. "Where is the Living Skeleton?"    "He has gone to his room," answered the Dragon, "he went early to-  night, he wasn't feeling well, I think."    "What is the number of his room?"    "No. 40," and the proprietor rang a loud, jangling bell, whereupon one  of the chambermaids appeared. "Show this gentleman to No. 40."    The girl preceded Robbins up the stairs. Once she looked over her  shoulder, and said in a whisper, "Is he worse?"    "I don't know," answered Robbins, "that's what I have come to see."    At No. 40 the girl paused, and rapped lightly on the door panel. There  was no response. She rapped again, this time louder. There was still no  response.    "Try the door," said Robbins.    "I am afraid to," said the girl.    "Why?"    "Because he said if he were asleep the door would be locked, and if he  were dead the door would be open."    "When did he say that?"    "He said it several times, sir; about a week ago the last time."    Robbins turned the handle of the door; it was not locked. A dim light  was in the room, but a screen before the door hid it from sight. When  he passed round the screen he saw, upon the square marble-topped  arrangement at the head of the bed, a candle burning, and its light  shone on the dead face of the Skeleton, which had a grim smile on its 
"I don't want to see you."    "Bert wants to say something. It's important. Let us in."    "I won't let you in. Go away and don't make a fuss. It will do no good.  You can get in ten minutes from now."    "Look here, Pony, you open that door at once, or I'll kick it in. You  hear me? I want to see you a minute, and then you can do what you  like," said Bert, in a voice that meant business.    After a moment's hesitation Rowell opened the door and the two stepped  in. Half of the carpet had been taken up and the bare floor was covered  with old newspapers. A revolver lay on the table, also writing  materials and a half-finished letter. Pony was in his shirt sleeves and  he did not seem pleased at the interruption.    "What do you want?" he asked shortly.    "Look here, Pony," said Bert, "I have confessed to Mellish and I've  come to confess to you. I want you to be easy with me and hush the  thing up. I cheated. I stocked the cards."    "You're a liar," said Rowell, looking him straight in the eye.    "Don't say that again," cried Ragstock, with his fingers twitching.  "There's mighty few men I would take that from."    "You stocked the cards on me? I'd like to see the man that could do  it!"    "You were excited and didn't notice it."    "You're not only a liar, but you're an awkward liar. I have lost the  money and I'll pay it. It would have been ready for you now, only I had  a letter to write. Mellish has told you about the insurance policy and  my will attached to it. Here they are. They're yours. I'm no kicker. I  know when a game's played fair."    Bert took the policy and evidently intended to tear it in pieces, while  Mellish, with a wink at him, edged around to get at the revolver.  Ragstock's eye caught the name in big letters at the head of the  policy, beautifully engraved. His eyes opened wide, then he sank into a 
both of them.    "Then it wasn't the engines, but the pumps," she said.    "And it wasn't the steam, but the fire," screamed Mrs. Assistant. "Oh,  dear, how that captain lied, and I thought him such a nice man, too.  Oh, I shall go into hysterics, I know I shall."    "I wouldn't if I were you," said the sensible Mrs. General, who was a  strong-minded woman; "besides, it is too late. We're all safe now. I  think both captains were pretty sensible men. Evidently married, both  of 'em."    Which was quite true.          THE DEPARTURE OF CUB MCLEAN.      Of course no one will believe me when I say that Mellish was in every  respect, except one, an exemplary citizen and a good-hearted man. He  was generous to a fault and he gave many a young fellow a start in life  where a little money or a few encouraging words were needed. He drank,  of course, but he was a connoisseur in liquors, and a connoisseur never  goes in for excess. Few could tell a humorous story as well as Mellish,  and he seldom dealt in chestnuts. No man can be wholly bad who never  inflicts an old story on his friends, locating it on some acquaintance  of his, and alleging that it occurred the day before.    If I wished to write a heart-rending article on the evils of gambling,  Mellish would be the man I would go to for my facts and for the moral  of the tale. He spent his life persuading people not to gamble. He  never gambled himself, he said. But if no attention was paid to his  advice, why then he furnished gamblers with the most secluded and  luxurious gambling rooms in the city. It was supposed that Mellish  stood in with the police, which was, of course, a libel. The idea of  the guardians of the city standing in with a gambler or a gambling  house! The statement was absurd on the face of it. If you asked any  policeman in the city where Mellish's gambling rooms were, you would  speedily learn that not one of them had ever even heard of the place. 
when a man did his best there were occasions when nothing he could do  would mollify her, and then there was sure to be trouble, although, he  added, in his desire to be fair, she was always sorry for it afterward.  Which remark, to his confusion, had turned the smile into a laugh.    He wondered what Eighty-six thought of the new man. Not much,  evidently, for she was losing time, which she had no business to do on  that section of the road. Still it might be the fault of the new man  not knowing when to push her for all she was worth and when to ease up.  All these things go to the making of time. But it was more than  probable that old Eighty-six, like Gilpin's horse, was wondering more  and more what thing upon her back had got. "He'll have trouble,"  muttered John to himself, "when she finds out."    The conductor came in again and sat down beside the engineer. He said  nothing, but sat there sorting his tickets, while Saggart gazed out of  the window. Suddenly the engineer sprang to his feet with his eyes wide  open. The train was swaying from side to side and going at great speed.    The conductor looked up with a smile.    "Old Eighty-six," he said, "is evidently going to make up for lost  time."    "She should be slowing down for crossing the G. & M. line," replied the  engineer. "Good heavens!" he cried a moment after, "we've gone across  the G. & M. track on the keen jump."    The conductor sprang to his feet. He knew the seriousness of such a  thing. Even the fastest expresses must stop dead before crossing on the  level the line of another railway. It is the law.    "Doesn't that fool in front know enough to stop at a crossing?"    "It isn't that." said Saggart. "He knows all right. Even the train boys  know that. Old Eighty-six has taken the bit between her teeth. He can't  stop her. Where do you pass No. 6 to-night?"    "At Pointsville."    "That's only six miles ahead," said the engineer; "and in five minutes 
gamble again in any shape or form."    "You will return the cash to the bank, if you took it from there?"    "Certainly. I will put it back the first thing on Monday morning."    "Then here is your pile," said Rowell, handing him the roll of bills.    Forme took it eagerly and, standing where the light struck down upon  him, counted the bills, while Rowell looked on silently with a cynical  smile on his lips.    "Thank you," said the young man, "you're a good fellow, Rowell."    "I'm obliged for your good opinion. I hope you found the money  correct?"    "Quite right," said Forme, flushing a little. "I hope you did not mind  my counting it. Merely a business habit, you know."    "Well, stick to business habits, Mr. Forme. Good night."    Rowell walked briskly back to Mellish's. Forme walked toward the  railway station and found that there was a train for Chicago at 4 in  the morning. He had one clear day and part of another before he was  missed, and as it turned out all trace of him was lost in the big city.  The bank found about $6,000 missing. Two years after, news came that  Forme had been shot dead in a gambling hall in Southern Texas.    "We are two first-class fools," said Rowell to Mellish, "and I for one  don't feel proud of the episode, so we'll say nothing more about it.  The gambling mania was in his blood. Gambling is not a vice; it is a  disease, latent in all of us."          THE BRUISER'S COURTSHIP.      While the Northern Bruiser sat in the chair in his corner and was being  fanned he resolved to finish the fight at the next round. The superior  skill of his opponent was telling upon him, and although the Bruiser  was a young man of immense strength, yet, up to that time, the  alertness and dexterity of the Yorkshire Chicken had baffled him, and  prevented him from landing one of his tremendous shoulder thrusts. But  even though skill had checkmated strength up to this point, the Chicken 
importance to the world than a presidential election. The rest of the  boys tried to cheer him up. "A fine state of things," said Murren  bitterly. "Think of the scrap next week between the California Duffer  and Pigeon Billy and no report of it in the Argus! Imagine the walk-  over for the other papers. What in thunder does he think people want to  read?"    But there was another surprise in store for the boys. McCrasky  assembled them all in his room and held forth to them. He suddenly  sprung a question on the criminal reporter--so suddenly that Thompson,  taken unawares, almost spoke the truth.    "Do you know of any gambling houses in this city?"    Thompson caught his breath and glanced quickly at Murren.    "No," he said at last. "I don't, but perhaps the religious editor does.  Better ask him."    The religious editor smiled and removed his corn-cob pipe.    "There aren't any," he said. "Didn't you know it was against the law to  keep a gambling house in this state? Yes, sir!" Then he put his corn-  cob pipe back in its place.    McCrasky was pleased to see that his young men knew so little of the  wickedness of a great city; nevertheless he was there to give them some  information, so he said quietly:    "Certainly it is against the law; but many things that are against the  law flourish in a city like this. Now I want you to find out before the  week is past how many gambling houses there are and where they are  located. When you are sure of your facts we will organize a raid and  the news will very likely be exclusive, for it will be late at night  and the other papers may not hear of it."    "Suppose," said the religious editor, with a twinkle in his eye, as he  again removed his corn-cob, "that--assuming such places to exist--you  found some representatives of the other papers there? They are a bad  lot, the fellows on the other papers."    "If they are there," said the local editor, "they will go to prison."  
brandy with the deftness of a Frenchman, filling it so that not a drop  more could be added, and yet without allowing the glass to overflow,  Streeter pulled out his purse.    "No, no!" cried Davison; "you are not going to pay for this--you are  drinking with me."    "I pay for my own drinks," said Streeter, surlily.    "Not when I invite you to drink with me," protested the critic. "I pay  for this brandy."    "Very well, take it, then!" said Streeter, picking up the little glass  and dashing the contents in the face of Davison.    Davison took out his handkerchief.    "What the devil do you mean by that, Streeter?" he asked, as the color  mounted to his brow.    Streeter took out his card and pencilled a word or two on the  pasteboard.    "There," he said, "is my Paris address. If you do not know what I mean  by that, ask your friend here; he will inform you."    And with that the novelist arose, bowed to the two, and departed.    When he returned to his hotel, after a stroll along the brilliantly-  lighted Boulevards, he found waiting for him Mr. Harmon and a  Frenchman.    "I had no idea you would come so soon," said Streeter, "otherwise I  would not have kept you waiting."    "It does not matter," replied Harmon; "we have not waited long. Affairs  of this kind require prompt action. An insult lasts but twenty-four  hours, and my friend and principal has no desire to put you to the  inconvenience of repeating your action of this evening. We are taking  it for granted that you have a friend prepared to act for you; for your  conduct appeared to be premeditated."    "You are quite right," answered Streeter; "I have two friends to whom I  shall be pleased to introduce you. Come this way, if you will be so  kind."    The preliminaries were speedily arranged, and the meeting was to take  place next morning at daylight, with pistols.    Now that everything was settled, the prospect did not look quite so 
typical of the growth of the city. The eloquent minister spoke of the  inscrutable ways of Providence in cutting off a man in his prime, and  in the very height of his usefulness.          THE FAILURE OF BRADLEY.      The skater lightly laughs and glides,  Unknowing that beneath the ice  On which he carves his fair device  A stiffened corpse in silence glides.

"If I only had the courage," said Bradley, as he looked over the stone  parapet of the embankment at the dark waters of the Thames as they  flashed for a moment under the glitter of the gaslight and then  disappeared in the black night to flash again farther down.    "Very likely I would struggle to get out again the moment I went over,"  he muttered to himself. "But if no help came it would all be done with,  in a minute. Two minutes perhaps.

little room was empty. He rang the bell, and the trim servant-girl  appeared.    "Has Mr. Scriver come in yet?"    "No, sir, he haven't."    "Perhaps the rain has kept him."    "Mr. Scriver said that when you come back, sir, there was a letter on  the table as was for you."    "Ah, so there is. Thank you, that will do."    The author opened the letter and read as follows:    "MY DEAR MR. RINGAMY,--Your arguments the other day fully convinced me  that you were right, and I was wrong ("Ah! I thought they would,"  murmured the author). I have therefore taken a step toward putting your  theories into practice. The scheme is an old one in commercial life,  but new in its present application, so much so that I fear it will find  no defenders except yourself, and I trust that now when I am far away  ("Dear me, what does this mean!" cried the author) you will show any  doubters that I acted on the principles which will govern the world  when the theories of 'Gazing Upward' are put into practice. For fear  that all might not agree with you at present, I have taken the  precaution of going to that undiscovered country, from whose bourne no  extradition treaty forces the traveler to return--sunny Spain. You said  you could not tell my rendition of your signature from your own.  Neither could the bank cashier. My exact mutation of your signature has  enabled me to withdraw ¬£10,000 from your bank account. Half the  profits, you know. You can send future accumulations, for the book will  continue to sell, to the address of  "ADAM SCRIVER.  _"Poste Restant, Madrid, Spain"_      Mr. Ringamy at once put the case in the hands of the detectives, where  it still remains.          A SLIPPERY CUSTOMER.      When John Armstrong stepped off the train at the Union Station, in 
The next day and the next they spun around the bay on the ice-boat.  Even Staples, who seemed to be tired of almost everything, liked the  swiftness and exhilaration of the iceboat.    One afternoon, Brown walked into the bar of the hotel, where he found  Staples standing.    "See here, Armstrong." he cried, slapping that gentleman on the  shoulder. "Are you in for a bit of sport? It's a nice moonlight night,  and I'm going to take a spin down to Hamilton to meet some chaps, and  we can come back on the iceboat, or if you think it too late, you can  stay over, and come back on the train."    "Hamilton? That's up the lake, isn't it?"    "Yes, just a nice run from here. Come along--I counted on you."    An hour later they were skimming along the frozen surface of the lake.    "Make yourself warm and snug," said Brown. "That's what the buffalo  robes are for. I must steer, so I have to keep in the open. If I were  you I'd wrap up in those robes and go to sleep. I'll wake you when  we're there."    "All right," answered Staples. "That's not a bad idea."    "General George Washington!" said young Brown to himself. "This is too  soft a snap altogether. I'm going to run him across the lake like a  lamb. Before he opens his eyes we'll have skimmed across the frozen  lake, and he'll find himself in the States again when he wakes up. The  only thing now to avoid are the air-holes and ice-hills, and I'm all  right."    He had been over the course before and knew pretty well what was ahead  of him. The wind was blowing stiffly straight up the lake and the boat  silently, and swifter than the fastest express, was flying from Canada  and lessening the distance to the American shore.    "How are you getting along, Walker," cried Staples, rousing himself up.  "First rate," answered Brown. "We'll soon be there, Staples."    That unfortunate slip of the tongue almost cost young Mr. Brown his  life. He had been, thinking of the man under his own name, and the name
