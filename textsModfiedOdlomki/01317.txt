had shown before. He knew the moves he had to make in any of three  eventualities. He watched the board to make sure he would not have to  make those moves before he was ready. His whole air was that of waiting:  the commander-in-chief of the army of the United States, waiting to hear  what he would be told by two strayed infantrymen, lost in the fog that  covered a battlefield.    *       *       *       *       *    The fog was neither more dense nor any lighter where Corporal Wallis  paused to roll his pre-war cigarette. The tobacco came from the gassed  machine-gunner in the pill-box a few yards off. Sergeant Coffee, three  yards distant, was a blurred figure. Corporal Wallis put his cigarette  into his mouth, struck his match, and puffed delicately.    "Ah!" said Corporal Wallis, and cheered considerably. He thought he saw  Sergeant Coffee moving toward him and ungenerously hid his cigarette's  glow.    Overhead, a machine-gun suddenly burst into a rattling roar, the sound  sweeping above them with incredible speed. Another gun answered it.  Abruptly, the whole sky above them was an inferno of such tearing noises  and immediately after they began a multitudinous bellowing set up.  Airplanes on patrol ordinarily kept their engines muffled, in hopes of  locating a tank below them by its noise. But in actual fighting there  was too much power to be gained by cutting out the muffler for any minor  motive to take effect. A hundred aircraft above the heads of the two  strayed infantrymen were fighting madly about five helicopters. Two  hundred yards away, one fell to the earth with a crash, and immediately  afterward there was a hollow boom. For an instant even the mist was  tinged with yellow from the exploded gasoline tank. But the roaring  above continued--not mounting, as in a battle between opposing patrols  of fighting planes, when each side finds height a decisive advantage,  but keeping nearly to the same level, little above the bank of cloud.
