  "Well, pilot?" said Mr. Fogg.    "Well, your honour," replied he, "I could not risk myself, my men, or  my little boat of scarcely twenty tons on so long a voyage at this time  of year.  Besides, we could not reach Yokohama in time, for it is  sixteen hundred and sixty miles from Hong Kong."    "Only sixteen hundred," said Mr. Fogg.    "It's the same thing."    Fix breathed more freely.    "But," added the pilot, "it might be arranged another way."    Fix ceased to breathe at all.    "How?" asked Mr. Fogg.    "By going to Nagasaki, at the extreme south of Japan, or even to  Shanghai, which is only eight hundred miles from here.  In going to  Shanghai we should not be forced to sail wide of the Chinese coast,  which would be a great advantage, as the currents run northward, and  would aid us."    "Pilot," said Mr. Fogg, "I must take the American steamer at Yokohama,  and not at Shanghai or Nagasaki."    "Why not?" returned the pilot.  "The San Francisco steamer does not  start from Yokohama.  It puts in at Yokohama and Nagasaki, but it  starts from Shanghai."    "You are sure of that?"    "Perfectly."    "And when does the boat leave Shanghai?"    "On the 11th, at seven in the evening.  We have, therefore, four days  before us, that is ninety-six hours; and in that time, if we had good  luck and a south-west wind, and the sea was calm, we could make those  eight hundred miles to Shanghai."    "And you could go--"    "In an hour; as soon as provisions could be got aboard and the sails  put up."    "It is a bargain.  Are you the master of the boat?"    "Yes; John Bunsby, master of the Tankadere."    "Would you like some earnest-money?"    "If it would not put your honour out--"    "Here are two hundred pounds on account sir," added Phileas Fogg,  turning to Fix, "if you would like to take advantage--"
