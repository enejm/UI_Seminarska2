 leaders. With them felled, and with us in control of the turret and the  helio-room we could force the crew to stay at their posts. There were,  Anita said, no navigators among Miko's crew. They would not dare oppose  us.    "But it should be done at once, Anita. In a few hours we will be at the  asteroid."    "Yes. I will go now--try and get the weapons."    "Where is Snap?"    "Still in the helio-room. One of the crew guards him."    Coniston was roaming the ship; he was still loitering on the deck,  watching our door. Hahn was in the turret. The morning watch of the crew  were at their posts in the hull-corridors; the stewards were preparing a  morning meal. There were nine members of subordinates altogether, Anita  had calculated. Six of them were in Miko's pay; the other three--our own  men who had not been killed in the fighting--had joined the brigands.    "And Dr. Frank, Anita?"    He was in the lounge. All the passengers were herded there, with Miko  and Moa alternating on guard.    "I will arrange it with Venza," Anita whispered swiftly. "She will tell  the others. Dr. Frank knows about it now. He thinks it can be done."    *       *       *       *       *    The possibility of it swept me anew. The brigands were of necessity  scattered singly about the ship. One by one, creeping under cover of an  invisible cloak, I could fell them, and replace them without alarming  the others. My thoughts leaped to it. We would strike down the guard in  the helio-room. Release Snap. At the turret we could assail Hahn, and  replace him with Snap.    Coniston's voice outside broke in upon us. "Prince."    He was coming forward. Anita stood in the doorway. "I have the figures,  Coniston. By God, this Haljan is with us! And clever! We think it will  total a hundred and thirty millions. What a stake!"
