another time I should have put a thousand to him myself; and he seeing  'twas no good sat by me in silence, using a spy-glass now and again to  make out the things floating at sea. As the day grew the men left the  fire at the back of the beach, and came down to the sea-front where the  waves were continually casting up fresh spoil. And there all worked with  a will, not each one for his own hand, but all to make a common hoard  which should be divided afterwards.    Among the flotsam moving outside the breakers I could see more than one  dark ball, like black buoys, bobbing up and down, and lifting as the  wave came by: and knew them for the heads of drowned men. Yet though I  took Ratsey's glass and scanned all carefully enough, I could make  nothing of them, but saw the pinnace floating bottom up, and farther out  another boat deserted and down to her gunwale in the water. 'Twas midday  before the first body was cast up, when the sky was breaking a little,  and a thin and watery sun trying to get through, and afterwards three  other bodies followed. They were part of the pinnace's crew, for all had  the iron ring on the left wrist, as Ratsey told me, who went down to see  them, though he said nothing of the branded 'Y', and they were taken up  and put under some sheeting at the back of the beach, there to lie till a  grave should be made ready for them.    Then I felt something that told me he was coming and saw a body rolled  over in the surf, and knew it for the one I sought. 'Twas nearest me he  was flung up, and I ran down the beach, caring nothing for the white  foam, nor for the under-tow, and laid hold of him: for had he not left  the rescue-line last night, and run down into the surf to save my  worthless life? Ratsey was at my side, and so between us we drew him up  out of the running foam, and then I wrung the water from his hair, and  wiped his face and, kneeling down there, kissed him.
