anything, the coolies. I remember working once with a crew of them that  thought--"    The professor stopped suddenly, for his daughter had uttered a little  cry of alarm. He felt her hand upon his arm, and turned toward her.    "What is it, dear?" he asked.    She was pointing toward the biggest amber block, and her eyes were wide  open and showed she had seen something, or imagined that she had seen  something, that frightened her.    *       *       *       *       *    Professor Young followed the direction of her finger. He saw that she  was staring at the black heart of the amber block; but when he looked he  could see nothing but the vague, irregular outline of the inky  substance.    "What is it, dear?" asked Young again.    "I--I thought I saw it looking out, eyes that stared at us--"    The girl broke off, laughed shortly, and added, "I suppose it was Mr.  Leffler's talking. There's nothing there now."    "Probably the Manchurian devil shows itself only to you," said her  father jokingly. "Well, be careful, dear. If it takes a notion to jump  out at you, call me and I'll exorcise it for you."    Betty blushed and laughed again. She looked at Marable, expecting to see  a smile of derision on the young man's face, but his expression was  grave.    The light from above was diminishing; outside sounded the roar of  home-going traffic.    "Well, we must go home," said Professor Young. "There's a hard and  interesting day ahead of us to-morrow, and I want to read Orling's new  work on matrices before we begin chipping at the amber."    Young turned on his heel and strode toward the locker at the end of the  room where he kept his coat and hat. Betty, about to follow him, was  aware of a hand on her arm, and she turned to find Marable staring at  her.
