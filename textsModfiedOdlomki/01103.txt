  *       *       *       *       *    Photographs, and photostats of restored pages of books, and transcripts  of inscriptions, were piled in front of her, and the notebooks in which  she was compiling her lists. She sat down, lighting a fresh cigarette,  and reached over to a stack of unexamined material, taking off the top  sheet. It was a photostat of what looked like the title page and  contents of some sort of a periodical. She remembered it; she had found  it herself, two days before, in a closet in the basement of the building  she had just finished examining.    She sat for a moment, looking at it. It was readable, in the sense that  she had set up a purely arbitrary but consistently pronounceable system  of phonetic values for the letters. The long vertical symbols were  vowels. There were only ten of them; not too many, allowing separate  characters for long and short sounds. There were twenty of the short  horizontal letters, which meant that sounds like -ng or -ch or -sh were  single letters. The odds were millions to one against her system being  anything like the original sound of the language, but she had listed  several thousand Martian words, and she could pronounce all of them.    And that was as far as it went. She could pronounce between three and  four thousand Martian words, and she couldn't assign a meaning to one of  them. Selim von Ohlmhorst believed that she never would. So did Tony  Lattimer, and he was a great deal less reticent about saying so. So, she  was sure, did Sachiko Koremitsu.

They did that, now, every  night in her dreams. And there were other dreams, in which she read them  as easily as English; waking, she would try desperately and vainly to
