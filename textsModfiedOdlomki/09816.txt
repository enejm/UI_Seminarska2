 the meantime he would wait and see.    The god remained quiet, made no movement; and White Fang's snarl slowly  dwindled to a growl that ebbed down in his throat and ceased.  Then the  god spoke, and at the first sound of his voice, the hair rose on White  Fang's neck and the growl rushed up in his throat.  But the god made no  hostile movement, and went on calmly talking.  For a time White Fang  growled in unison with him, a correspondence of rhythm being established  between growl and voice.  But the god talked on interminably.  He talked  to White Fang as White Fang had never been talked to before.  He talked  softly and soothingly, with a gentleness that somehow, somewhere, touched  White Fang.  In spite of himself and all the pricking warnings of his  instinct, White Fang began to have confidence in this god.  He had a  feeling of security that was belied by all his experience with men.    After a long time, the god got up and went into the cabin.  White Fang  scanned him apprehensively when he came out.  He had neither whip nor  club nor weapon.  Nor was his uninjured hand behind his back hiding  something.  He sat down as before, in the same spot, several feet away.  He held out a small piece of meat.  White Fang pricked his ears and  investigated it suspiciously, managing to look at the same time both at  the meat and the god, alert for any overt act, his body tense and ready  to spring away at the first sign of hostility.    Still the punishment delayed.  The god merely held near to his nose a  piece of meat.  And about the meat there seemed nothing wrong.  Still  White Fang suspected; and though the meat was proffered to him with short  inviting thrusts of the hand, he refused to touch it.  The gods were all-  wise, and there was no telling what masterful treachery lurked behind  that apparently harmless piece of meat.  In past experience, especially  in dealing with squaws, meat and punishment had often been disastrously  related.
