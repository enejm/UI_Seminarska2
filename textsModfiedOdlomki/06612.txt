 'I said "work".'    He smiled blandly.  'I reckoned you'd tumble to it.  Why, yes, except  that I've some figuring still to do.  Give me half an hour and I'll be  at your service, Major.'    That afternoon, after Peter had cooked a wonderfully good luncheon, I  had a heart-to-heart talk with Blenkiron.
