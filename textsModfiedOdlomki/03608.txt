to another across the street. Just on the other side of the crowd was  the entrance to the main store of the Save-Your-Life Co.    *       *       *       *       *    Dan crossed the street and saw a very average-looking man, wearing an  orange cape, come to a stop at the corner and look shrewdly around.    Dan blinked and looked again. _The man in orange was no Porcyn._    The man's glance fell on the statue and his lips twisted in an amused  smile. He looked up toward the rope, then down at the crowd, and then  studied the backs of the crowd and the fronts of the stores around him,  the lids of his eyes half-closed in a calculating look.

He went through his files and gave Dan a big photograph  showing a smiling, healthy, middle-aged couple and a lovely girl about  nineteen.    "These are the Milbuns, sir.
