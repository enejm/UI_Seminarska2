began the grimmest fight with death, from which ever I hope to emerge  victorious. Slowly, furiously, almost hopelessly, I strove; and that  faithful Pepper led me, dragged me, upward and onward, until, at last,  ahead I saw a gleam of blessed light. It was the entrance. Only a few  yards further, and I reached the opening, with the water surging and  boiling hungrily around my loins.    And now I understood the cause of the catastrophe. It was raining  heavily, literally in torrents. The surface of the lake was level with  the bottom of the opening--nay! more than level, it was above it.  Evidently, the rain had swollen the lake, and caused this premature  rise; for, at the rate the ravine had been filling, it would not have  reached the entrance for a couple more days.    Luckily, the rope by which I had descended, was streaming into the  opening, upon the inrushing waters. Seizing the end, I knotted it  securely 'round Pepper's body, then, summoning up the last remnant of my  strength, I commenced to swarm up the side of the cliff. I reached the  Pit edge, in the last stage of exhaustion. Yet, I had to make one more  effort, and haul Pepper into safety.    Slowly and wearily, I hauled on the rope. Once or twice, it seemed that  I should have to give up; for Pepper is a weighty dog, and I was utterly  done. Yet, to let go, would have meant certain death to the old fellow,  and the thought spurred me to greater exertions. I have but a very hazy  remembrance of the end. I recall pulling, through moments that lagged  strangely. I have also some recollection of seeing Pepper's muzzle,  appearing over the Pit edge, after what seemed an indefinite period of  time. Then, all grew suddenly dark.        _XIII_    THE TRAP IN THE GREAT CELLAR    I suppose I must have swooned; for, the next thing I remember, I opened  my eyes, and all was dusk. I was lying on my back, with one leg doubled  under the other, and Pepper was licking my ears. I felt horribly stiff,  and my leg was numb, from the knee, downward. For a few minutes, I lay
