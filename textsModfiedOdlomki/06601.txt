occupies the post that once was Harry Bullivant's.  Richard Hannay is  where he longed to be, commanding his battalion on the ugliest bit of  front in the West.  Mr John S.  Blenkiron, full of honour and wholly  cured of dyspepsia, has returned to the States, after vainly  endeavouring to take Peter with him.  As for Peter, he has attained the  height of his ambition.  He has shaved his beard and joined the Flying  Corps.        CONTENTS      1.  A Mission is Proposed  2.  The Gathering of the Missionaries  3.  Peter Pienaar  4.

It was at Furling, the big country house in  Hampshire where I had come to convalesce after Loos, and Sandy, who was  in the same case, was hunting for the marmalade.  I flung him the  flimsy with the blue strip pasted down on it, and he whistled.    'Hullo, Dick, you've got the battalion.  Or maybe it's a staff billet.
