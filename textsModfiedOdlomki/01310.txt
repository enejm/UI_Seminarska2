  Hope gasped, "This way."    She led us back into the pavilion. We clambered over its broken seats,  past its grewsome huddled figures. Some were still moving.... We went to  a small door under the platform. A dim room was here, deserted now.  Against the wall was a large wardrobe closet; stage costumes were  hanging in it. The closet was fully twenty feet deep. We pushed our way  through the hanging garments. Hope fumbled at the blank board wall in  the rear. Her groping fingers found a secret panel. A door swung aside  and a rush of dank cool air came at us. The dark outlines of a tunnel  stretched ahead.    "In, Charlie!"    I crouched and stepped through the door. Hope closed it behind us.

A palace guard was standing  there. His pike went up.    "Who are you?"    "A friend."    But the man lunged with his pike. Derek leaped aside. His sword flashed;
