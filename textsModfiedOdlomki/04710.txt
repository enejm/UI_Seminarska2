 "I've got a much better idea than that," she said cheerily, getting a  pad and pencil from her red handbag. "How about giving Droozle this  ultimatum?" As she wrote, Jean read over her shoulder, "'Suggest you  begin writing fiction pleasing both to you and your master, or we shall  be forced to hand you over to the dog catcher!'"    Jean drew back amazed. "Why, we would do no such thing!"    "I know it, silly. I'm just negotiating."    "No," he grumped, ready to be angry with her. He got up and strode  around the studio. "The dog catcher! We will not lie to that snake!"    Judy dropped the idea. "I've just now thought of another one. Here's an  ultimatum we could give him and mean it, too. No more writing until we  reach an agreement, or we will take away all his writing paper and  reading matter for good!"    "I'd thought of doing that," Jean conceded. "But isn't that a monstrous  way to treat a literary genius?"    "Not at all!" she protested. "By taking on a work that will require more  time than his lifetime, he is defeating himself."    "There's that way of looking at it," agreed the artist. "All right,  Droozle," he called. "You heard us talking and you know we mean it. No  more writing until we reach an agreement--or else!"    Droozle quit writing at once. While the girl and the young artist  watched anxiously, Droozle first wandered about uncertainly for a few  minutes and then curled up on a newspaper and went to sleep.    He slept all evening.    *       *       *       *       *    "He has beaten us again," Jean Lanni told Judy Stokes resignedly when  she arrived at his studio the following evening. He watched Droozle  fascinatedly as the snake moved his restless tail over the margins of  newspapers spread on the floor. "He doesn't know yet that I know. I  discovered the fraud only by the merest accident."
