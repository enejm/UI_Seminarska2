The end of it was that we saw Idernes and his captain advancing,  followed by a guard of ten men. Then after I had explained all things to  my officers, I also advanced with Bes, followed by a guard of ten picked  men. We met between the armies on a little sandy plain at the foot of  the rise and there followed talk between the captains of our guards as  to arms and so forth, but we four said nothing to each other, since the  time for words was past.
