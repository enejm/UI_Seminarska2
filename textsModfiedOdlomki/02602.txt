glimpsed. These gave way to allow their passage when their conductor  uttered a hissing order, and then they were moving down a shorter hall  at whose end also were guards. As these sprang aside before them, a  great door of massive metal they guarded moved softly upward,  disclosing a mighty circular hall or room inside. Their crocodilian  guide turned to them.    "The hall of the Martian Master," he hissed.    They passed inside with him. The great hall seemed to extend upward to  the giant cone's tip, thin light coming down from an opening there.  Upon the dull metal of its looming walls were running friezes of  lighter metal, grotesque representations of reptilian shapes that they  could but vaguely glimpse. Around the walls stood rank after rank of  guards.    At the hall's center was a low dias, and in a semicircle around and  behind it stood a half-hundred great crocodilian shapes. Randall  guessed even at the moment that they were the council of which their  conductor had named himself a member. But like Milton and Lanier, he  had eyes in that first moment only for the dais itself. For on it  was--the Martian Master.    Randall heard Milton and Lanier choke with the horror that shook his  own heart and brain as he gazed. It was not simply another great  crocodilian shape that sat upon that dais.
