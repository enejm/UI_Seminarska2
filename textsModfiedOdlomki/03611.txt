  Dan fell asleep, content that he had the answer to that part of the  problem, at least.    Before it was light, he awoke to an odd familiar buzz inside his head.    "Dan," said Kielgaard's voice, small and remote.    Dan rolled over, lay on his back and spoke sub-vocally. "Right here."    "Can you talk?"    "Yes," said Dan, "if I can stay awake."    "Can you give us a summary?"    "Sure." Dan told him briefly what had happened.    Kielgaard was silent a moment. Then he said, "What do you think  'charge' is?"    "I haven't been in any condition to think. Maybe it's a surgically  implanted battery, set to run down after so long."    "Too clumsy. What about radioactivity?"    "H'm. Yes, you mentioned a mine on the inner planet. Maybe they mine  radioactive ore. That would explain why I have _some_ charge. There's  residual radioactivity even in the atmosphere of Earth."    "That's so," said Kielgaard. "But not every planet has it. I'm  wondering about this other agent you mentioned seeing. He sounds to me  like someone from Trans-Space. And that's bad."    "They play dirty," Dan conceded.    *       *       *       *       *    "Worse than that," said Kielgaard's tiny voice. "They recruit their  agents from Lassen Two. Maybe that's a break. Unlike Earth, Lassen Two  is nearly radiation-free. And Trans-Space doesn't use finesse. They'll  pump Porcys full of agents loaded down with organo-transmitters.  Visual, auditory and olfactory. They'll broadcast on every wave-length,  suck out as much information in as short a time as they can, then  either pull some dirty trick or slam the Porcyns an offer. That is, if  everything goes according to plan.    "But meanwhile," he added, "one or more of their agents is bound to  stand in front of a free 'Your charge' device somewhere in the city.  Very likely, that agent will be radiation-free and some Porcyn, for
