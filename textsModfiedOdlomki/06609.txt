treated me as if I were a dangerous man, whereas all their conduct  hitherto had shown that they thought me a fool.  I could not understand  it.    'But I had not been one night in that Neuburg place before I thought of  the reason.  They wanted to keep me under observation as a check upon  you, Cornelis.  I figured it out this way.  They had given you some  very important work which required them to let you into some big  secret.  So far, good.
