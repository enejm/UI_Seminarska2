dots and dashes. I have not; but ... well, the fact is, sir, that I  have been getting some mighty queer sounds for the past few nights.  They've got me guessing.    "If you wouldn't mind waiting. Captain; they're about due now--" He  listened again to some signal inaudible to the others, then hooked up  two extra head-sets for the officers.    "It's on now," he said. "If you don't mind--"    McGuire grinned at the captain as they took up the ear-phones. "Power  of suggestion," he whispered, but the smile was erased from his lips  as he listened. For in his ear was sounding a weird and wailing note.    No dots or dashes, as the operator had said, but the signal was  strong. It rose and fell and wavered into shrill tremolos, a ghostly,  unearthly sound, and it kept on and on in a shrill despairing wail.  Abruptly it stopped.    The captain would have removed the receiver from his ear, but the  operator stopped him. "Listen," he said, "to the answer."    *       *       *       *       *    There was silence, broken only by an occasional hiss and crackle of  some far distant mountain storm. Then, faint as a whisper, came an  answering, whistling breath.    It, too, trembled and quavered. It went up--up--to the limit of  hearing; then slid down the scale to catch and tremble and again  ascend in endless unvarying ups and downs of sound. It was another  unbroken, unceasing, but always changing vibration.    "What in thunder is that?" Captain Blake demanded.    "Communication of some sort, I should say," McGuire said slowly, and  he caught the operator's eyes upon him in silent agreement.    "No letters," Blake objected; "no breaks; just that screech." He  listened again. "Darned if it doesn't almost seem to say something,"  he admitted.    "When did you first hear this?" he demanded of the radio man.    "Night before last, sir. I did not report it. It seemed too--too--"
