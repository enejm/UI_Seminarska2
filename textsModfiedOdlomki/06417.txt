man turned and ran out of the tent.    Then I remembered what I wanted to say.  I struggled from the bed and  put my hands on his shoulders.    'Laputa is our side of the highroad.  Cut him off from his men, and  drive him north--north--away up to the Rooirand. Never mind the  Wolkberg and the guns, for they can wait.  I tell you Laputa is the  Rising, and he has the collar.  Without him you can mop up the Kaffirs  at your leisure.  Line the high-road with every man you have, for he  must cross it or perish. Oh, hurry, man, hurry; never mind me.  We're  saved if we can chivy Laputa till morning.  Quick, or I'll have to go  myself.'    The tent emptied, and I lay back on the bed with a dim feeling that my  duty was done and I could rest.  Henceforth the affair was in stronger  hands than mine.  I was so weak that I could not lift my legs up to the  bed, but sprawled half on and half off.    Utter exhaustion defeats sleep.  I was in a fever, and my eyes would  not close.  I lay and drowsed while it seemed to me that the outside  world was full of men and horses.  I heard voices and the sound of  hoofs and the jingle of bridles, but above all I heard the solid tramp  of an army.  The whole earth seemed to be full of war.  Before my mind  was spread the ribbon of the great highway.  I saw it run white through  the meadows of the plateau, then in a dark corkscrew down the glen of  the Letaba, then white again through the vast moonlit bush of the  plains, till the shanties of Wesselsburg rose at the end of it.  It  seemed to me to be less a road than a rampart, built of shining marble,  the Great Wall of Africa.  I saw Laputa come out of the shadows and try  to climb it, and always there was the sound of a rifle-breech clicking,  a summons, and a flight.  I began to take a keen interest in the game.
