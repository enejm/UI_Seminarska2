 Passed the beautiful young Countess of Southshire walking near  Belgrave Square yesterday. As usual, she was _parfaitement mise_. Was  sorry for _her_ sake, but glad for my own, to hear her sneeze twice,  for she is considered to have easily the most musical sneeze in  London. Talk of sneezing, during the 'flu epidemic Madame Fallalerie  has been giving a course of lessons, "How to sneeze prettily" (twenty  guineas the course), and her reception-rooms in Bond Street have been  simply packed.    Absolutely _everybody_ seemed to be lunching at Kickshaw's yesterday!  Lord and Lady Oldacres were at a table with some of their children,  which reminds me of the fact that family parties are rather good form  just now. It's not at all unusual to see husbands and wives together,  and children, both small and grown-up, are quite _often_ with their  parents.    *       *       *       *       *    MR.
