though Nature were brooding over some tragedy which was being enacted in  her sight.    “It was quiet--quiet as death, and lonely as the grave.    “‘Mashune,’ I said at last, ‘where is Hans? my heart is heavy for him.’    “‘Nay, my father, I know not; mayhap he is weary, and sleeps, or mayhap  he has lost his way.’    “‘Mashune, art thou a boy to talk folly to me?’ I answered. ‘Tell me,  in all the years thou hast hunted by my side, didst thou ever know a  Hottentot to lose his path or to sleep upon the way to camp?’    “‘Nay, Macumazahn’ (that, ladies, is my native name, and means the man  who ‘gets up by night,’ or who ‘is always awake’), ‘I know not where he  is.’    “But though we talked thus, we neither of us liked to hint at what was  in both our minds, namely, that misfortunate had overtaken the poor  Hottentot.    “‘Mashune,’ I said at last, ‘go down to the water and bring me of those  green herbs that grow there. I am hungered, and must eat something.’    “‘Nay, my father; surely the ghosts are there; they come out of the  water at night, and sit upon the banks to dry themselves. An Isanusi[*]  told it me.’    [*] _Isanusi_, witch-finder.    “Mashune was, I think, one of the bravest men I ever knew in the  daytime, but he had a more than civilized dread of the supernatural.    “‘Must I go myself, thou fool?’ I said, sternly.    “‘Nay, Macumazahn, if thy heart yearns for strange things like a sick  woman, I go, even if the ghosts devour me.’    “And accordingly he went, and soon returned with a large bundle of  watercresses, of which I ate greedily.    “‘Art thou not hungry?’ I asked the great Zulu presently, as he sat  eyeing me eating.    “‘Never was I hungrier, my father.’    “‘Then eat,’ and I pointed to the watercresses.    “‘Nay, Macumazahn, I cannot eat those herbs.’    “‘If thou dost not eat thou wilt starve: eat, Mashune.’
