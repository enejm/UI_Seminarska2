Would you like to hear something of it by way of preparation?'    In a low gentle voice he began to tell me mysteries of awful cruelty.  At first I scarcely heard him, but as he went on my brain seemed to  wake from its lethargy.  I listened with freezing blood.  Not in my  wildest nightmares had I imagined such a fate.  Then in despite of  myself a cry broke from me.    'It interests you?' Laputa asked.  'I could tell you more, but  something must be left to the fancy.  Yours should be an active one,'  and his hand gripped my shaking wrist and felt my pulse.    'Henriques will see that the truth does not fall short of my forecast,'  he went on.  'For I have appointed Henriques your executioner.'    The name brought my senses back to me.    'Kill me,' I said, 'but for God's sake kill Henriques too.  If you did  justice you would let me go and roast the Portugoose alive.  But for me  the Snake would be over the Lebombo by this time in Henriques' pocket.'    'But it is not, my friend.  It was stolen by a storekeeper, who will  shortly be wishing he had died in his mother's womb.'    My plan was slowly coming back to me.    'If you value Prester John's collar, you will save my life. What will  your rising be without the Snake?  Would they follow you a yard if they  suspected you had lost it?'    'So you would threaten me,' Laputa said very gently.  Then in a burst  of wrath he shouted, 'They will follow me to hell for my own sake.  Imbecile, do you think my power is built on a trinket?  When you are in  your grave, I will be ruling a hundred millions from the proudest  throne on earth.'    He sprang to his feet, and pulled back a shutter of the window, letting  a flood of light into the hut.  In that light I saw that he had in his  hands the ivory box which had contained the collar.
