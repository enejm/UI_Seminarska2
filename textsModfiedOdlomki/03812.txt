   I think back and try not to. In the hermetically sealed cylinder back  upstairs among my Americana Spink I have some photographs, Circa 1945.  One is of a citizen of old Nazi Germany who was supposed to have  cremated himself in a bunker. Papers there record that my forebear,  Cyril Spink, had his doubts at the time.    "I am the Neofeuhrer, Earthman," this creep says. "I will conquer the  universe."    "Look," I says, pawing beads of sweat as big as the creep's eyes from my  brow, "have you been testin' atom bombs and worse down here?"    "Jar."    "There, I knew Professor Zalpha was off the beam," I yelp at Wurpz.  "This is what is causin' the earthquakes."    "Come, schwine," the creep says. "I will show you something. The tomb of  my ancestor. Then to the museum to show you how he arrived in Subterro  in the year 1945. This is the city of Adolfus. Mach schnell! Heil  Hitler. I am Agrodyte Hitler, grandson of the Liberator."    The short hairs on the back of my neck start crawling down my spine. We  leave the Mole and walk along a big square paved with a mineral we never  saw upstairs. Thousands of inhabitants of Subterro hiss at us and click  their long black fingers. We walk up a long flight of steps and come to  a cadaver memorial and on the front there are big letters and numerals  in what looks like bloodstone that says: ADOLPH HITLER. 1981.    "Jar, Earthmen, mortal enemies of Subterro's hero, you thought he did  not escape, hah? Come, we go to the museum."    We do. In a glass case is an antique U-boat. "I can't believe it," I  says to Zahooli.    "Neither do I. We never took off. They have us locked up in the booby  hatch in Metropolita. We went nuts."    "He escaped in a submarine, bringing three of Nazi Germany's smartest  scientists with him. He brought plans showing us he could split the  atom. He brought working models." The creep laughs mockingly. "We have  certain elements down here also. Puranium, better than your uranium.
