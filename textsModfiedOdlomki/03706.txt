 of one of the twins. The words or sounds were in a language completely  foreign to him. He thought to knock, but changed his mind. To knock  would have made it obvious he had been listening. He barged right in.    The twins were in the anteroom. Muldoon got the impression they knew he  had heard them, and an even stronger impression, that the fact was of no  importance. That bothered him, for some reason.    "Ah, there you are," the twin to the left said. "Evin was wondering  whether you would show up, but I told him he was putting himself to  useless aggravation."    That damned mixed-up phrasing again, Muldoon thought. "Took a little  time to find parking space," he said.    "Shall we be off, then?" Robert asked.    "All right with me," Muldoon replied. There was another odd thing. Evin  Reeger seemed to have so very little to say.    Their destination was a place halfway down the Island. Muldoon's brow  had lifted when they gave him the area. So far as he knew there hadn't  been any development in the area. It was just a bit too far off the  highways and rail lines for housing developments, and even more badly  located for industrial requirements. He wondered what the devil they  had in mind out there.    Traffic was light and the drive took little more than an hour and a half  on the main highway, and another fifteen minutes of blacktop side road  before Evin told him to "Turn left here," onto a rutted path off the  blacktop. The path led through some scrub growth that ended on the edge  of an acre or so of dump heap. Rusted heaps of broken cars were  scattered about. A foul odor came from the left as though garbage, too,  had been dumped and left to rot. There was a flat one-storied wooden  shack close by to which Evin directed him to drive up to.    *       *       *       *       *
