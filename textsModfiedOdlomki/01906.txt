For now his  responsibilities were greater than they had ever been before, and he had  need of all his faculties.

But he refused to ponder on how Dalis the  betrayer had gained possession of the secret sign manual he had believed  known only to Jaska and himself. That, too, might be explained  satisfactorily, for Dalis was cunning.    From the side of the laboratory opposite the Revolving Beryl came a soft  tinkling sound, like the striking of a musical bell. Sarka rose wearily,  strode to the wall, where a narrow aperture opened, in which rested Food  Capsules sufficient for one meal for three men. He smiled wryly.

Just as the slightest sound flies outward through space endlessly, and  the slightest vibration moves outward until the end of time and of  space, Sarka knew that the vibration set up by the Beryl, slight though
