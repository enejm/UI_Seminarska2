There wasn't more than an inch of the fungus, but that inch stuck.  There was no removing it.    "No use, boss," gasped the negro, pausing breathless. "Cain't do it.  Nothin' to do, I guess, but wait an' see what de Kite does. He'll sure  want this ship and the horn."    "I know," his captain answered slowly.
