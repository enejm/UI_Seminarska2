he stood abashed, and then he said in what was almost hysteria, "I've  got to speak to Red. I've got to say something."    Red looked up in fright, but the Astronomer said, "I don't think, son,  you're being very polite. You've kept lunch waiting."    "I'm sorry, Father."    "Oh, don't rate the lad," said the Industrialist's wife. "He can speak  to Red if he wants to, and there was no damage done to the lunch."    "I've got to speak to Red alone," Slim insisted.    "Now that's enough," said the Astronomer with a kind of gentleness that  was obviously manufactured for the benefit of strangers and which had  beneath it an easily-recognized edge. "Take your seat."    Slim did so, but he ate only when someone looked directly upon him. Even  then he was not very successful.    Red caught his eyes. He made soundless words, "Did the animals get  loose?"    Slim shook his head slightly. He whispered, "No, it's--"    The Astronomer looked at him hard and Slim faltered to a stop.    With lunch over, Red slipped out of the room, with a microscopic motion  at Slim to follow.    They walked in silence to the creek.    Then Red turned fiercely upon his companion. "Look here, what's the idea  of telling my Dad we were feeding animals?"    Slim said, "I didn't. I asked what you feed animals. That's not the same  as saying we were doing it. Besides, it's something else, Red."    But Red had not used up his grievances. "And where did you go anyway? I  thought you were coming to the house. They acted like it was my fault  you weren't there."    "But I'm trying to tell you about that, if you'd only shut _up_ a second  and let me talk. You don't give a fellow a chance."    "Well, go on and tell me if you've got so much to say."    "I'm _trying_ to. I went back to the space-ship. The folks weren't there  anymore and I wanted to see what it was like."    "It isn't a space-ship," said Red, sullenly. He had nothing to lose.
