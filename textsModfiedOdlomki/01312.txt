  "Certainly," stammered Quest.    Stunned by the swiftness of the transaction, he sat staring at the money  that lay untouched before him.    To accept it would be like signing an unread contract. But he had asked  for it; to refuse it was impossible. Even to delay about picking it up  might arouse Clason's suspicion. Already the latter had turned away and  was opening the door of a steel cabinet. Quest had one second in which  to reach a decision.... He crammed the currency into his pocket.    *       *       *       *       *    With delicate care Clason set two objects on the table.

Within it a series of concentric tissues were suspended  from metal rings, and in a trough outside ranged four stoppered flasks  containing liquids of as many different colors.    "Look at these models carefully," said Clason. "They represent two of  the most remarkable discoveries of all time. The one on your left is the  most _de_structive weapon known to man. The other I consider the most  _con_structive discovery in the history of science. It may even lead to  an understanding of the nature of life, and of the future of the spirit  after death.    "Both of these were developed by my brother Philip and me together--but  we have disagreed about the use to which they shall be put.

If I should permit him to do that, it might lead to the destruction  of whole nations!"    "How?" demanded Quest "I've heard of a device called the Death Ray. Is  this it?"    "No, no," said Clason contemptuously. "Even in a perfected state the Ray  would be a child's toy compared to the Projector. This is based on our
