the death above or the death below.    He felt a soft, warm pad upon the fingers of one of his hands where  they circled the branch to which he clung, and then something reached  down out of the blackness above and dragged him up among the branches  of the tree.          Chapter 24      Sometimes lolling upon Tantor's back, sometimes roaming the jungle in  solitude, Korak made his way slowly toward the West and South.  He made  but a few miles a day, for he had a whole lifetime before him and no  place in particular to go. Possibly he would have moved more rapidly  but for the thought which continually haunted him that each mile he  traversed carried him further and further away from Meriem--no longer  his Meriem, as of yore, it is true! but still as dear to him as ever.    Thus he came upon the trail of The Sheik's band as it traveled down  river from the point where The Sheik had captured Meriem to his own  stockaded village.  Korak pretty well knew who it was that had passed,  for there were few in the great jungle with whom he was not familiar,  though it had been years since he had come this far north.  He had no  particular business, however, with the old Sheik and so he did not  propose following him--the further from men he could stay the better  pleased he would be--he wished that he might never see a human face  again.  Men always brought him sorrow and misery.    The river suggested fishing and so he dawdled upon its shores, catching  fish after a fashion of his own devising and eating them raw.  When  night came he curled up in a great tree beside the stream--the one from  which he had been fishing during the afternoon--and was soon asleep.  Numa, roaring beneath him, awoke him.  He was about to call out in  anger to his noisy neighbor when something else caught his attention.  He listened.  Was there something in the tree beside himself?  Yes, he  heard the noise of something below him trying to clamber upward.
