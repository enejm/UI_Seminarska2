  "The atoms and their electrons, he said, were in turn made up of  sub-atoms and were perhaps populated by sentient beings who looked  through their telescopes and counted the atoms in their vicinity, no  doubt arranging them into constellations. You can carry this imaginary  process in both directions and as far as you like, but are we to decide  arbitrarily that it goes on infinitely? Or is it like Einsteinian  space, finite but unbounded?    "I have asked myself this question and I believe the latter statement  to be in a sense correct, but what does it mean? Well, it means  that if you move further and further into larger universes, you  eventually get to where you started. Not that Big is the same thing  as Small, but that from wherever you happen to be, the ones in the  direction--outward--look successively bigger, while the ones in the  other direction--inward--look successively smaller. Now if there were  some kind of super-telescope that could look beyond our universe of  super-atoms, and beyond the next and so on indefinitely, you would find  yourself staring up through a super-microscope at your own eye."    "Get along with you!" Katherine said. "This is the pipe dream to end  all pipe dreams. Tell us more."    *       *       *       *       *    "Well, I'll revise it to this extent," said Phil. "It wouldn't be your  eye that you'd see, any more than you'd see your own face if you looked  far enough across ordinary intergalactic space. You'd see the back of  your head--or, rather, the other side of the Earth--provided there was  nothing in the way."    "And in this case it would be what?" she asked.    "I don't know," Phil said, looking worried. "What is the equivalent of  the back of your head--looked at along the direction of hyper-time?  Could it be that what you saw would not be from behind, but from ...  inside?"    Katherine's beautiful sightless eyes seemed to be turned inward, and
