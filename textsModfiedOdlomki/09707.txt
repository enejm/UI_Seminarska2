'What is that--"Rishti"?'    'Eye-rishti--that was the Regiment--my father's.'    'Irish--oh, I see.'    'Yess.  That was how my father told me.  My father, he has lived.'    'Has lived where?'    'Has lived.  Of course he is dead--gone-out.'    'Oh!  That's your abrupt way of putting it, is it?'    Bennett interrupted.  'It is possible I have done the boy an injustice.  He is certainly white, though evidently neglected.  I am sure I must  have bruised him.  I do not think spirits--'    'Get him a glass of sherry, then, and let him squat on the cot. Now,  Kim,' continued Father Victor, 'no one is going to hurt you. Drink that  down and tell us about yourself.  The truth, if you've no objection.'    Kim coughed a little as he put down the empty glass, and considered.  This seemed a time for caution and fancy.  Small boys who prowl about  camps are generally turned out after a whipping. But he had received no  stripes; the amulet was evidently working in his favour, and it looked  as though the Umballa horoscope and the few words that he could  remember of his father's maunderings fitted in most miraculously.  Else  why did the fat padre seem so impressed, and why the glass of hot  yellow drink from the lean one?    'My father, he is dead in Lahore city since I was very little.  The  woman, she kept kabarri shop near where the hire-carriages are.' Kim  began with a plunge, not quite sure how far the truth would serve him.    'Your mother?'    'No!'--with a gesture of disgust.  'She went out when I was born. My  father, he got these papers from the Jadoo-Gher what do you call that?'  (Bennett nodded) 'because he was in good-standing.  What do you call  that?'  (again Bennett nodded).  'My father told me that.  He said,  too, and also the Brahmin who made the drawing in the dust at Umballa  two days ago, he said, that I shall find a Red Bull on a green field  and that the Bull shall help me.'
