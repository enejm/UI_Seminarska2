Meanwhile the Scarecrow was taken apart and  the painted sack that served him for a head was carefully laundered and  restuffed with the brains originally given him by the great Wizard. His  clothes were also cleaned and pressed by the Imperial tailors, and his crown  polished and again sewed upon his head, for the Tin Woodman insisted he  should not renounce this badge of royalty.

So Jinjur sent post-haste for old Mombi, the witch, and promised her large  rewards if she would come to the assistance of the rebel army.
