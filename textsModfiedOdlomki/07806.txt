 "How so?"    "Yes, monsieur, we were obliged to renounce the cestus. He cracked  heads; he broke jaws--beat in ribs. It was charming sport; but nobody  was willing to play with him."    "Then his wrist--"    "Oh, monsieur, firmer than ever. Monseigneur gets a trifle weaker in his  legs,--he confesses that himself; but his strength has all taken refuge  in his arms, so that--"    "So that he can knock down bullocks, as he used to formerly."    "Monsieur, better than that--he beats in walls. Lately, after having  supped with one of our farmers--you know how popular and kind  monseigneur is--after supper, as a joke, he struck the wall a blow. The  wall crumbled away beneath his hand, the roof fell in, and three men and  an old woman were stifled."    "Good God, Mousqueton! And your master?"    "Oh, monseigneur, a little skin was rubbed off his head. We bathed the  wounds with some water which the monks gave us. But there was nothing  the matter with his hand."    "Nothing?"    "No, nothing, monsieur."    "Deuce take the Olympic pleasures! They must cost your master too dear;  for widows and orphans--"    "They all had pensions, monsieur; a tenth of monseigneur’s revenue was  spent in that way."    "Then pass on to Friday," said D’Artagnan.    "Friday, noble and warlike pleasures. We hunt, we fence, we dress  falcons and break horses. Then, Saturday is the day for intellectual  pleasures: we adorn our minds; we look at monseigneur’s pictures and  statues; we write, even, and trace plans: and then we fire monseigneur’s  cannon."    "You draw plans, and fire cannon?"    "Yes, monsieur."    "Why, my friend," said D’Artagnan, "M. du Vallon, in truth, possesses  the most subtle and amiable mind that I know. But there is one kind of  pleasure you have forgotten, it appears to me."    "What is that, monsieur?" asked Mousqueton, with anxiety.    "The material pleasures."    Mousqueton colored. "What do you mean by that, monsieur?" said he,  casting down his eyes.
