 kind of work." Blades would frankly rather have had her behind him on  a motorskimmer, hanging on as they careened through a springtime  countryside. He was glad when they reached the main forward air lock  and debarked.    He was still gladder when the suits were off. Lieutenant Ziska in  dress uniform was stunning, but Ellen in civvies, a fluffy low-cut  blouse and close-fitting slacks, was a hydrogen blast. He wanted to  roll over and pant, but settled for saying, "Welcome back" and holding  her hand rather longer than necessary.    With a shy smile, she gave him a package.
