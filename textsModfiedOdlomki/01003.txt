time, so far as known, in his lifetime; then he tiptoed to his own  apartments, lest Billy--the lazy young rascal was still abed in the  next room--should awaken and discover his knowledge of this act of  flat rebellion.    I dare say the old gentleman was so completely accustomed to having  his own way that this unlooked-for opposition tickled him by its  novelty; or perhaps he recognised in Billy an obstinacy akin to his  own; or perhaps it was merely that he loved the boy. In any event, he  never again alluded to the subject; and it is a fact that when  Billy sent for carpenters to convert an upper room into an atelier,  Frederick R. Woods spent two long and dreary weeks in Boston in order  to remain in ignorance of the entire affair.    Billy scrambled through college, somehow, in the allotted four years.  At the end of that time, he returned to find new inmates installed at  Selwoode.    For the wife of Frederick R. Woods had been before her marriage one of  the beautiful Anstruther sisters, who, as certain New Yorkers still  remember--those grizzled, portly, rosy-gilled fellows who prattle  on provocation of Jenny Lind and Castle Garden, and remember  everything--created a pronounced furor at their d√©but in the days of  crinoline and the Grecian bend; and Margaret Anstruther, as they  will tell you, was married to Thomas Hugonin, then a gallant cavalry  officer in the service of Her Majesty, the Empress of India.    And she must have been the nicer of the two, because everybody who  knew her says that Margaret Hugonin is exactly like her.    So it came about naturally enough, that Billy Woods, now an _Artium  Baccalaureus_, if you please, and not a little proud of it, found the  Colonel and his daughter, then on a visit to this country, installed  at Selwoode as guests and quasi-relatives. And Billy was twenty-two,  and Margaret was nineteen.    *       *       *       *       *    Precisely what happened I am unable to tell you. Billy Woods claims
