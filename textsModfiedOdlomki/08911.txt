was I who put out the fire; my wrists were burnt in doing so.”    Then for a space we sat silent, looking at each other, while Stella  slowly fanned herself with her wide felt hat, in which some white  ostrich plumes were fixed.    “This is God’s doing,” she said at last. “You saved my life when I was  a child; now I have saved yours and the little girl’s.
