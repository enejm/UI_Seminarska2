   "So it would seem, Three Eagles," Grey Beaver answered, laying his hand  on the cub; "and this be the sign of it."    The cub snarled a little at the touch of the hand, and the hand flew back  to administer a clout.  Whereupon the cub covered its fangs, and sank  down submissively, while the hand, returning, rubbed behind his ears, and  up and down his back.    "This be the sign of it," Grey Beaver went on.
