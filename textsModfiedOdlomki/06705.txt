good game to see just how far you could get into the forbidden land. A  man like you could put up a good bluff on those hayseeds. I don't mind  having a bet ...'    'No,' I said. 'I'm out for a rest, and not for sport. If there was  anything to be gained I'd undertake to bluff my way to the Orkney  Islands. But it's a wearing job and I've better things to think about.'    'So? Well, enjoy yourself your own way. I'll be sorry when you leave  us, for I owe you something for that rough-house, and beside there's  darned little company in the old moss-back captain.'    That evening Gresson and I swopped yarns after supper to the  accompaniment of the 'Ma Goad!' and 'Is't possible?' of captain and  mate. I went to bed after a glass or two of weak grog, and made up for  the last night's vigil by falling sound asleep. I had very little kit  with me, beyond what I stood up in and could carry in my waterproof  pockets, but on Amos's advice I had brought my little nickel-plated  revolver. This lived by day in my hip pocket, but at night I put it  behind my pillow. But when I woke next morning to find us casting  anchor in the bay below rough low hills, which I knew to be the island  of Colonsay, I could find no trace of the revolver. I searched every  inch of the bunk and only shook out feathers from the mouldy ticking. I  remembered perfectly putting the thing behind my head before I went to  sleep, and now it had vanished utterly. Of course I could not advertise  my loss, and I didn't greatly mind it, for this was not a job where I  could do much shooting. But it made me think a good deal about Mr  Gresson. He simply could not suspect me; if he had bagged my gun, as I  was pretty certain he had, it must be because he wanted it for himself  and not that he might disarm me. Every way I argued it I reached the  same conclusion. In Gresson's eyes I must seem as harmless as a child.
