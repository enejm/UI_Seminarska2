as "N'gombi (Interior)," but who were neither N'gombi nor Isisi, nor of  any known branch of the Bantu race, but known as "the people of the  well." They had remarkable legends, sayings which they ascribed to a  mythical Idoosi; also they have a song which runs:    O well in the forest!  Which chiefs have digged;  No common men touched the earth,  But chiefs' spears and the hands of kings.    Now there is no doubt that both the sayings of Idoosi and the song of  the well have come down from days of antiquity, and that Idoosi is none  other than the writer of the lost book of the Bible, of whom it is  written:    "Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not  written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy  of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the vision of Idoo the  seer?"[10]....    [Footnote 10: Chronicles II., ix. 29.]    And is not the Song of the Well identical with that brief extract from  the Book of Wars of the Lord--lost to us for ever--which runs:    "Spring up, O well: sing ye unto it: The well, which the princes  digged, Which the nobles of the people delved, With the sceptre ...  with their staves."[11]    [Footnote 11: Numbers xxi. 17.]    Some men say that the People of the Well are one of the lost tribes, but  that is an easy solution which suggests itself to the hasty-minded.  Others say that they are descendants of the Babylonian races, or that  they came down from Egypt when Rameses II died, and there arose a new  dynasty and a Pharaoh who did not know the wise Jewish Prime Minister  who ruled so wisely, who worshipped in the little temple at Karnac, and  whose statue you may see in Cairo with a strange Egyptian name.
