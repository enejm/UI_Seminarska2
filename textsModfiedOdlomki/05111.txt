seriously injured, but I predict...."    I left and went on down the corridor.    So Bill Bart was giving me a play! What kind of crazy guess-work was  he foisting on his public, I wondered, and came to the desk room.  I looked in at the door. On one side, a sergeant was talking to an  elderly worried-looking couple and never turned his head. On the other,  a gray-haired lieutenant sitting at the raised desk dropped his glasses  as I came in. They fell on the floor and smashed.    "Mother of God!" he muttered and gave me a cursory glance. "Good night,  Doctor," he said. "Not that there's anything good about it." He was  fumbling in the desk as I walked out of the door.    *       *       *       *       *    On the other side of the street, in the shadows, was a man who crossed  over as I came down the steps. It was McGill.    "I had a hunch this might happen," he said, taking my arm. "The car's  up ahead. Vinelli came here as quick as he could, but he slipped coming  along the street and broke his ankle."    "Judas!" I said. "I _am_ sorry! I feel responsible. Where are we going?"    He didn't answer me at first; he just kept hurrying me along. One of  those New York siroccos was pretending to cool the city, and at the  corner I saw his old coupe with the parking lights on. A saloon next to  us was closing up and a few late customers came out onto the sidewalk.  One customer, on seeing me, stopped and turned to the others.    "That's the guy I was telling you about! That's Graham!"    I saw then that it was our telephone repairman from the afternoon. He  looked reasonably sober, but his friends did not.    "Oh, yeah?" one of these said, eying me belligerently. "I thought we  just heard Bill Bart broadcast the cops had him."
