 On the fifth table lay a dwarf. Its ridiculous body was not over four  and a half feet long, though the head was larger than that of a normal  man. In the old dark ages on Earth this body would have served for the  jester of a lord, the comic butt of a king; in more recent times as  the prize of a circus side-show. The huge, weighty head with its ugly  brooding mask of a face, the child's body below--this was for the  brain of Professor Erich Geinst, the solitary German who had stood  preeminent on Earth in astronomy.    *       *       *       *       *    These creatures were the result of Hawk Carse's desperate search. They  had composed, with one other, the band of isuanacs that had been  rooting in the swamp at the end of the lake when the asteroid had  first arrived. The Hawk had remembered them, and had quickly seen that  they were the only answer to the problem. And so, with Ban Wilson, he  had gone out for them, his mind steeled to the ghastly thought of the  great scientists' brains in such bodies. In space-suits they had swept  down on them. There had been no time for considerate measures: the  four isuanacs had been abruptly knocked out by the impact of the great  suits swooping against them, and carried back to the laboratory.    Eliot Leithgow had been shocked at the idea of a scientist's brain in  the head of the robot-coolie; how much greater, then, was his horror  when confronted by the need of using these appalling remnants of men!  But he could not protest. What else was there? Ku Sui, under the V-27,  had spoken the truth: the operations would be impossible without the  aid of his four assistants. The brains even now were dying. The choice  was: bodies of isuanacs or death for the brains. The scientist and the  adventurer had chosen.    Circumstances had required their use. Ku Sui's attempt to kill the  brains, thus inflicting a time limit: the presence of the band of
