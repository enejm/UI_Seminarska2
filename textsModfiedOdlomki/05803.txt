  *       *       *       *       *    I had crossed a long, rounded expanse of rock--lava, wonderfully  colored--and was descending into a boulder-cluttered pocket. I was  nearing the "bottom" of the chunk, the part that had been the deepest  beneath Sorn's surface before the blow-up. It was the likeliest place to  look for fossils.    But instead of looking for fossils, my eyes kept rising to those  incredible stars. You get that way particularly after several weeks of  living in steel; and it was lucky that I got that way this time, or I  might have missed the Zen.    My feet tangled with a rock. I started a slow, light-gravity fall, and  looked down to catch my balance. My torch beam flickered across a small,  red-furred teddy-bear shape. The light passed on.
