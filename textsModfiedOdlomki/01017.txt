parochial, restrained for the most part by a lively apprehension of  the law. But now the spell of the Eagle was strong upon him.    "Lady," said Mr. Flinks, twisting in his grimy hand the bill she had  given him--and there, too, the Eagle flaunted in his vigour and  heartened him, "lady, that ain't much for you to give.
