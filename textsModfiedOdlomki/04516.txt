tape. The first is how I got here. I've remembered something from my  military training, when I did some parachute jumps. Terminal velocity  for a human body falling through air is about one hundred twenty m.p.h.  Falling fifty miles is no worse than falling five hundred feet. You'd be  lucky to live through a five hundred foot fall, true, but I've been  lucky. The suit is bulky but light and probably slowed my fall. I hit a  sixty mile an hour updraft this side of the mountain, skidded downhill  through about half a mile of snow and fetched up in a drift. The suit is  part worn but still operational. I'm fine.    "The second thing I want to say is about the Chingsi, and here it is:  watch out for them. Those jokers are dangerous. I'm not telling how  because I've got a scientific reputation to watch. You'll have to figure  it out for yourselves. Here are the clues:    (1) The Chingsi talk and laugh but after all they aren't human. On an  alien world a hundred light-years away, why shouldn't alien  talents develop? A talent that's so uncertain and rudimentary here  that most people don't believe it, might be highly developed out  there.    (2) The _Whale_ expedition did fine till it found Chang. Then it hit a  seam of bad luck. Real stinking bad luck that went on and on till  it looks fishy. We lost the ship, we lost the launch, all but one  of us lost our lives. We couldn't even win a game of ping-pong.    "So what is luck, good or bad? Scientifically speaking, future chance  events are by definition chance. They can turn out favorable or not.  When a preponderance of chance events has occurred unfavorably, you've  got bad luck. It's a fancy name for a lot of chance results that didn't  go your way. But the gambler defines it differently. For him, luck  refers to the future, and you've got bad luck when future chance events
