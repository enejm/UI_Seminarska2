mean that man was wholly master of his destiny. He can't and he never  will.    "There's an unknown quantity comes in, Parrish. It is God, and that's  what's going to beat him in the end."    "I've not been as idle as Tode thinks," said Parrish, with a senile  leer. "I know more about the Atom Smasher than he dreams of. He thinks  me just an old fool, the remnants of whose brains are useful to him in  his laboratory. That's why he's kept me alive so far. He'll find out  his mistake," he chuckled. "I have something Tode doesn't dream of."    Suddenly Parrish's air of intense seriousness vanished. He chuckled  and fumbled in his rags. Jim felt a small object like a lever pressed  into his hand and then withdrawn.    "It's death, Dent," chuckled old Parrish. "The concentrated essence of  the destructive principle. It's a lever I fitted into a concealed  groove in the Atom Smasher unknown to Tode. This lever has a universal  joint and connects with a hidden chamber, and when pulled will  catapult the annihilated components of a small quantity of uranium in  any direction we desire. The release of the slumbering energy of this  uranium will produce an explosion of proportions beyond the wildest  dreams of engineers--perhaps, one great enough to throw the Earth out  of its orbit!"    "Uranium!... Breaking up its components!" gasped Jim. "You mean you  can actually do that?"    "Yes!" chuckled Parrish. "I'm keeping it for the day when Tode becomes  a god. When he's steadied the boat in time-space and halted the march  of the past, and when he's got Lucille--then, Dent, I shall so pull  the lever that it will release the energy straight at Tode--and  destroy the Atom-Smasher, ourselves, and even, perhaps, the whole  Earth!"    And he burst into a peal of such wild laughter that Jim realized the  old man's wits were gone.    *       *       *       *       *
