  "You're bread, aren't you?" she asked.    "Yes; bread and butter.  The butter is inside me, so it won't melt and  run.  I do the running myself."    At this joke all the others burst into a chorus of laughter, and  Dorothy thought they couldn't be much afraid if they could laugh like  that.    "Couldn't I eat something besides people?" she asked.  "Couldn't I eat  just one house, or a side-walk or something?  I wouldn't mind much what  it was, you know."    "This is not a public bakery, child," replied the man, sternly.  "It's  private property."    "I know Mr.--Mr.--"    "My name is C. Bunn, Esquire," said the man.  "'C' stands for Cinnamon,  and this place is called after my family, which is the most  aristocratic in the town."    "Oh, I don't know about that," objected another of the queer people.  "The Grahams and the Browns and Whites are all excellent families, and  there is none better of their kind.  I'm a Boston Brown, myself."    "I admit you are all desirable citizens," said Mr. Bunn rather stiffly;  "but the fact remains that our town is called Bunbury."    "'Scuse me," interrupted Dorothy; "but I'm getting hungrier every  minute.  Now, if you're polite and kind, as I'm sure you ought to be,  you'll let me eat SOMETHING.  There's so much to eat here that you will  never miss it."    Then a big, puffed-up man, of a delicate brown color, stepped forward  and said:    "I think it would be a shame to send this child away hungry, especially  as she agrees to eat whatever we can spare and not touch our people."    "So do I, Pop," replied a Roll who stood near.    "What, then, do you suggest, Mr. Over?" inquired Mr. Bunn.    "Why, I'll let her eat my back fence, if she wants to.  It's made of  waffles, and they're very crisp and nice."    "She may also eat my wheelbarrow," added a pleasant looking Muffin.  "It's made of nabiscos with a zuzu wheel."
