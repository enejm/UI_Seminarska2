straight job of tackling a man my strength miraculously returned.  It  was even so now.  I lay on my side, luxuriating in being still, and  slowly a sort of vigour crept back into my limbs.  Perhaps a half-hour  of rest was given me before, on the lip of the gully, I saw figures  appear.  Looking down I saw several men who had come across from the  opposite side of the valley, scrambling up the stream.
