 was only Anita.    Life is very strange! The gate to the shining garden of our love seemed  swinging wide to let us in. Yet I recall that a vague fear still lay on  me. A premonition?    I felt a touch on my arm. A bloated helmet visor was thrust near my own.  I saw Snap's face peering at me.    "Grantline thinks we should return to the _Planetara_. Might find some  of them alive."    Grantline touched me. "It's only humanity."    "Yes," I said.    We went back. Some ten of us--a line of grotesque figures bounding with  slow, easy strides over the jagged, rock-strewn plain. Our lights danced  before us.    The _Planetara_ came at last into view. My ship. Again that pang swept  me as I saw her. This, her last resting place. She lay here in her open  tomb, shattered, broken, unbreathing. The lights on her were  extinguished. The Erentz system had ceased to pulse--the heart of the  dying ship, for a while beating faintly, but now at rest.    We left the two girls with some of Grantline's men at the admission  port. Snap, Grantline and I, with three others, went inside. There still  seemed to be air, but not enough so that we dared remove our helmets.    It was dark inside the wrecked ship. The corridors were black; the hull  control-rooms were dimly illumined with Earth-light straggling through  the windows.    This littered tomb! Already cold and silent with death. We stumbled over  a fallen figure. A member of the crew.    *       *       *       *       *    Grantline straightened from examining him.    "Dead."    Earth-light fell on the horrible face. Puffed flesh, bloated red from  the blood which had oozed from its pores in the thinning air. I looked  away.    We prowled further. Hahn lay dead in the pump-room.    The body of Coniston should have been near here. We did not see it.
