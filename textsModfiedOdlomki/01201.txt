  And the MS. itself--You must picture me, when first it was given into my  care, turning it over, curiously, and making a swift, jerky examination.  A small book it is; but thick, and all, save the last few pages, filled  with a quaint but legible handwriting, and writ very close. I have the  queer, faint, pit-water smell of it in my nostrils now as I write, and  my fingers have subconscious memories of the soft, "cloggy" feel of the  long-damp pages.

The whole land is bare and  unpeopled, the very earth scarcely covering the rock that lies beneath  it, and with which the country abounds, in places rising out of the soil  in wave-shaped ridges.    Yet, in spite of its desolation, my friend Tonnison and I had elected to  spend our vacation there. He had stumbled on the place by mere chance
