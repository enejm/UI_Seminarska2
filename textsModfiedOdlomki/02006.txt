  The machine was withdrawn, Norman and Hackett were released, and the  frog-men, with their black force-pistols watchfully raised, withdrew,  the door clanging. The room settled back to quietness, the green men  stretching in lassitude on the metal bunks around it. The two fliers  crouched down near the door, shuddering nausea and weakness still  holding them.    Norman found that Hackett was laughing weakly. "To think that  twenty-four hours ago I was in New York," he half-laughed,  half-sobbed. "On Earth--Earth--"    The other gripped his arm. "It's horrible, Hackett, I know.
