 wanted me to try a shot, but I would not, knowing that the chances of  hitting it were small indeed. With only three charges, or rather three  caps left, it was necessary to be saving.    We halted and held a consultation, as a result of which we decided  that there was no more danger in going on than in standing still or  attempting to return. So we went on, keeping close together. To me, as  I was the only one with a rifle, was accorded what I did not at all  appreciate, the honour of heading the procession.    Another half-mile and again we heard that strange rolling sound which  was produced, I believe, by the great brute beating upon its breast, but  noted that it was not so continuous as on the previous night.    “Ha!” said Hans, “he can only strike his drum with one stick now. Your  bullet broke the other, Baas.”    A little farther and the god roared quite close, so loudly that the air  seemed to tremble.    “The drum is all right, whatever may have happened to the sticks,” I  said.    A hundred yards or so more and the catastrophe occurred. We had reached  a spot in the forest where one of the great trees had fallen down,  letting in a little light. I can see it to this hour. There lay the  enormous tree, its bark covered with grey mosses and clumps of a giant  species of maidenhair fern. On our side of it was the open space  which may have measured forty feet across, where the light fell in a  perpendicular ray, as it does through the smoke-hole of a hut. Looking  at this prostrate trunk, I saw first two lurid and fiery eyes that  glowed red in the shadow; and then, almost in the same instant, made  out what looked like the head of a fiend enclosed in a wreath of the  delicate green ferns. I can’t describe it, I can only repeat that it  looked like the head of a very large fiend with a pallid face, huge  overhanging eyebrows and great yellow tushes on either side of the  mouth.
