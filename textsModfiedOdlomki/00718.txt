   "Now," said the Wizard, "we must start for home.  But how are we going  to carry that big gold flower-pot?  Cap'n Bill can't lug it all the  way, that's certain."    "No," acknowledged the sailor-man; "it's pretty heavy.  I could carry  it for a little while, but I'd have to stop to rest every few minutes."    "Couldn't we put it on your back?" Dorothy asked the Cowardly Lion,  with a good-natured yawn.    "I don't object to carrying it, if you can fasten it on," answered the  Lion.    "If it falls off," said Trot, "it might get smashed an' be ruined."    "I'll fix it," promised Cap'n Bill.  "I'll make a flat board out of one  of these tree trunks, an' tie the board on the lion's back, an' set the  flower-pot on the board."  He set to work at once to do this, but as he  only had his big knife for a tool his progress was slow.    So the Wizard took from his black bag a tiny saw that shone like silver  and said to it:    "Saw, Little Saw, come show your power;  Make us a board for the Magic Flower."      And at once the Little Saw began to move and it sawed the log so fast  that those who watched it work were astonished.  It seemed to  understand, too, just what the board was to be used for, for when it  was completed it was flat on top and hollowed beneath in such a manner  that it exactly fitted the Lion's back.    "That beats whittlin'!" exclaimed Cap'n Bill, admiringly.  "You don't  happen to have TWO o' them saws; do you, Wizard?"    "No," replied the Wizard, wiping the Magic Saw carefully with his silk  handkerchief and putting it back in the black bag.  "It's the only saw  of its kind in the world; and if there were more like it, it wouldn't  be so wonderful."    They now tied the board on the Lion's back, flat side up, and Cap'n  Bill carefully placed the Magic Flower on the board.
