  “No, he only suspected, from what he had been told of the nature of the  works, that it was some celebrated soldier or another.”    “The devil!” said Porthos, “if I had only known that!”    “You would not have run away from Vannes as you did, perhaps?”    “No; what did you say when you couldn’t find me?”    “My dear fellow, I reflected.”    “Ah, indeed; you reflect, do you? Well, and what did that reflection  lead to?”    “It led me to guess the whole truth.”    “Come, then, tell me what did you guess after all?” said Porthos,  settling himself into an armchair, and assuming the airs of a sphinx.    “I guessed, in the first place, that you were fortifying Belle-Isle.”    “There was no great difficulty in that, for you saw me at work.”    “Wait a minute; I also guessed something else,--that you were fortifying  Belle-Isle by M. Fouquet’s orders.”    “That’s true.”    “But even that is not all. Whenever I feel myself in trim for guessing,  I do not stop on my road; and so I guessed that M. Fouquet wished to  preserve the most absolute secrecy respecting these fortifications.”    “I believe that was his intention, in fact,” said Porthos.    “Yes, but do you know why he wished to keep it secret?”    “In order it should not become known, perhaps,” said Porthos.    “That was his principal reason. But his wish was subservient to a bit of  generosity--”    “In fact,” said Porthos, “I have heard it said that M. Fouquet was a very  generous man.”    “To a bit of generosity he wished to exhibit towards the king.”    “Oh, oh!”    “You seem surprised at that?”    “Yes.”    “And you didn’t guess?”    “No.”    “Well, I know it, then.”    “You are a wizard.”    “Not at all, I assure you.”    “How do you know it, then?”    “By a very simple means. I heard M. Fouquet himself say so to the king.”
