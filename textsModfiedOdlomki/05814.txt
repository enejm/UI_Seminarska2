  And suddenly I was having one of those eye-popping third-row-center  views of the whole scene: the enormous, beautiful sky; the dead clod,  Vesta; the little creature who stood there staring at me--the  brilliant-ignorant, humanlike-alien, old-young creature who was asking  me to kill her.    For a moment the human quality of her thinking terrified me ... the  feeling you might have waking up some night and finding your pet puppy  sitting on your chest, looking at you with wise eyes and white fangs  gleaming ...    Then I thought of Yurt--smart, friendly Yurt, who had learned to laugh  and wisecrack--and I came out of the jeebies. I realized that here was  only a sick girl, no tiny monster.

When I told him what had happened, he was very quiet; crying, perhaps,  just like a human being, with happiness.    Cap Feldman asked me what was up, and I told him, and he said, "Well,  I'll be blessed!"    I said, "Yurt, are you sure you want us to keep hands off ... just go
