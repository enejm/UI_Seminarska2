 Turning, Ken saw that the torpoon had cracked through the weakened  quarsteel and tumbled in a mad cascade of water to the deck of the  abandoned second compartment. In dread silence, he, with Sallorsen and  those of the men who had strength and curiosity enough to come  forward, watched the compartment rapidly fill--watched until they saw  the water pressed high against the door.
