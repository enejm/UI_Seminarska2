For a tense minute there was silence between them, until, in a low,  crisp voice, the Hawk added:    "Three men in space-suits like ours, coming from the "north" straight  for Tantril's. Ban, you may not be able to see them till they get to  the ranch, so you keep hunting for the asteroid with your glasses.  Friday, you see them?"    "Yes, suh! Three! One ahead of the others!"
