and in a few moments I felt quite normal.    "How fast are we going?" I asked.    "Only two hundred miles an hour," he replied. "We will reach the layer  in plenty of time at this rate and I don't want to jam into it. You can  get up now."    I rose, moved over to the observation glass in the floor, and looked  down. We were already five or ten miles above the earth and were  ascending rapidly. I could still detect the great circle of reflectors  with which our way was to be opened.    "How can you tell where these heat beams are when they are turned on?" I  asked. "Infra-red rays are not visible, and we will soon be out of sight  of the reflectors."    "I forgot to mention that I am having a small portion of visible red  rays mixed with the infra-red so that we can spot them. I have a radio  telephone here, working on my private wavelength, so that I can direct  operations from here as well as from the ground--in fact, better. If  you're cold, turn on the heater."    *       *       *       *       *    The friction of the flyer against the air had so far made up for the  decreasing temperature of the air surrounding us, but a glance at the  outside thermometer warned me that his suggestion was a wise one. I  turned a valve which diverted a small portion of our exhaust through a  heating coil in the flyer. It was hard to realize that I was actually in  a rocket space ship, the second one to be flown and that, with the  exception of the ill-fated Hadley, farther from the earth than any man  had been before. There was no sensation of movement in that hermetically  sealed flyer, and, after the first few moments, the steady drone of the  rocket motor failed to register on my senses. I was surprised to see  that there was no trail of detritus behind us.
