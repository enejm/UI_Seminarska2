Then she picked it out upon the keyboard, and (to my surprise) instantly  enriched the same with well-sounding chords, and sang, as she played,  with a very droll expression and broad accent—    “Haenae I got just the lilt of it?  Isnae this the tune that ye whustled?”    “You see,” she says, “I can do the poetry too, only it won’t rhyme.  And  then again:    “I am Miss Grant, sib to the Advocate:  You, I believe, are Dauvit Balfour.”    I told her how much astonished I was by her genius.    “And what do you call the name of it?” she asked.    “I do not know the real name,” said I.  “I just call it _Alan’s air_.”    She looked at me directly in the face.  “I shall call it _David’s air_,”  said she; “though if it’s the least like what your namesake of Israel  played to Saul I would never wonder that the king got little good by it,  for it’s but melancholy music.  Your other name I do not like; so if you  was ever wishing to hear your tune again you are to ask for it by mine.”    This was said with a significance that gave my heart a jog.  “Why that,  Miss Grant?” I asked.    “Why,” says she, “if ever you should come to get hanged, I will set your  last dying speech and confession to that tune and sing it.”    This put it beyond a doubt that she was partly informed of my story and  peril.  How, or just how much, it was more difficult to guess.  It was  plain she knew there was something of danger in the name of Alan, and  thus warned me to leave it out of reference; and plain she knew that I  stood under some criminal suspicion.  I judged besides that the harshness  of her last speech (which besides she had followed up immediately with a  very noisy piece of music) was to put an end to the present conversation.
