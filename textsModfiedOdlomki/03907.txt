"Medicine?"    "Nope."    "I give up."    "It's animal serum," Bob said, sliced his thumb on the sardine can,  glanced unemotionally at the cut, ignored it.    "What's animal serum, Bob?"    "It's certain properties without which the universe in eternity regards  for human beings."    "Oh," Bonnie said. She took off her apron and sat down at the other end  of the kitchen. The smell from the juicer was beginning to reach her  stomach.    Bobby combed the kitchen for something else to throw into his  concoction and came up with some oregano and liquid garlic.    "I guess this is about it," he said.    He poured the garlic and oregano into his juicer, put the lid on, shook  it furiously for a minute and then emptied the contents into a deep pot.    "What are you doing now, Bob?" Bonnie asked.    "You have to cook it for seven minutes."    *       *       *       *       *    Bobby lit the stove, put a cover on the pot, set the timer for ten  minutes and left the room. Bonnie tagged after him and the two of them  got involved in a rough game of basketball in the living room.    "BING!" said the timer.    Bob dropped the basketball on Bonnie's head and ran back into the  kitchen.    "It's all done," he said, and took the cover off the pot. Only his  dedication to his work kept him from showing the discomfort he felt  with the smell that the pot gave forth.    "Fyew!" said Bonnie. "What do we do with it now? Throw it out?"    "No, stupid. We have to stir it till it cools and then drink it."    "Drink it?" Bonnie wrinkled her nose. "How come we have to drink it?"    Bobby said, "Because that's what you do with experiments, stupid."    "But, Bob, it smells like garbage."
