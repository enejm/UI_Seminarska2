knows better than we can whether it is a crime, a fault, or a  meritorious deed. I repent of it? Egad! no. Upon my honor and by the  holy cross; I only regret it because she was a woman.”    “The most satisfactory part of the matter,” said D’Artagnan, “is that  there remains no trace of it.”    “She had a son,” observed Athos.    “Oh! yes, I know that,” said D’Artagnan, “and you mentioned it to me;  but who knows what has become of him? If the serpent be dead, why not  its brood? Do you think his uncle De Winter would have brought up that  young viper? De Winter probably condemned the son as he had done the  mother.”    “Then,” said Athos, “woe to De Winter, for the child had done no harm.”    “May the devil take me, if the child be not dead,” said Porthos. “There  is so much fog in that detestable country, at least so D’Artagnan  declares.”    Just as the quaint conclusion reached by Porthos was about to bring back  hilarity to faces now more or less clouded, hasty footsteps were heard  upon the stair and some one knocked at the door.    “Come in,” cried Athos.    “Please your honors,” said the host, “a person in a great hurry wishes  to speak to one of you.”    “To which of us?” asked all the four friends.    “To him who is called the Comte de la Fere.”    “It is I,” said Athos, “and what is the name of the person?”    “Grimaud.”    “Ah!” exclaimed Athos, turning pale. “Back already! What can have  happened, then, to Bragelonne?”    “Let him enter,” cried D’Artagnan; “let him come up.”    But Grimaud had already mounted the staircase and was waiting on the  last step; so springing into the room he motioned the host to leave it.  The door being closed, the four friends waited in expectation. Grimaud’s  agitation, his pallor, the sweat which covered his face, the dust which  soiled his clothes, all indicated that he was the messenger of some  important and terrible news.
