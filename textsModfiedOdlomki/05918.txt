  The girl's eyes didn't waver from his. "I remember," she said slowly,  "I remember that I felt as if I could throw conventions into the wind  at the very first time we met. I've always been frank with you, as  much as I could be in my position. So then I don't mind telling you now  that ... I like you immensely, Semper."    As if agitated by some electric shock, Lee's arm tightened around the  girl's waist. "Oona, I have asked you once before to be my wife. You  said you couldn't and I thought it was because you didn't like me well  enough. But now, after what you've just told me, now that we both know  about The Brain and that I wasn't insane in my observations, I'm asking  you again: Be my wife, Oona, and then let's go together--anywhere--away  from all this, to the end of the world."    In the darkness her uplifted white face shone like the moon; there were  two limpid luminous pools in it. All of a sudden they overflowed with  tears streaming down her cheeks. Her mouth half opened, swallowed hard.  There was now nothing left of that "integrated personality", nothing of  the calm and the poise which the younger set of scientists admired so  much. There was only a young woman torn with torment.    "I would have loved to go with you to the end of the world when we were  floating over the Canyon. I would love to go with you a thousand times  more tonight," Lee heard her say and then the gnashing of her teeth as  she continued: "But it cannot be, Semper. It cannot be because my die is  cast, because my fate is made. Did nobody ever tell you? Didn't you even  guess? Howard and I--we've been living together for the past six years.  He's not a very good man; rather beyond good and evil; but then: I feel  that I have got to stick to him now more than ever."    The golden helmet of her hair dropped to Lee's breast. "I'm ashamed,"  she sobbed, "terribly, terribly ashamed, Semper. I've made such a mess  of things, of you and me--such a mess of my whole life."
