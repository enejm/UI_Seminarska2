last.  I go; but I shall return!"  And the son of Tarzan skipped across  the room, slipped through the open window, and slid to liberty by way  of the down spout from an eaves trough.    Mr. Moore wriggled and struggled about the bed.  He was sure that he  should suffocate unless aid came quickly.  In his frenzy of terror he  managed to roll off the bed.  The pain and shock of the fall jolted him  back to something like sane consideration of his plight.  Where before  he had been unable to think intelligently because of the hysterical  fear that had claimed him he now lay quietly searching for some means  of escape from his dilemma.  It finally occurred to him that the room  in which Lord and Lady Greystoke had been sitting when he left them was  directly beneath that in which he lay upon the floor.  He knew that  some time had elapsed since he had come up stairs and that they might  be gone by this time, for it seemed to him that he had struggled about  the bed, in his efforts to free himself, for an eternity.  But the best  that he could do was to attempt to attract attention from below, and  so, after many failures, he managed to work himself into a position in  which he could tap the toe of his boot against the floor.  This he  proceeded to do at short intervals, until, after what seemed a very  long time, he was rewarded by hearing footsteps ascending the stairs,  and presently a knock upon the door.  Mr. Moore tapped vigorously with  his toe--he could not reply in any other way.  The knock was repeated  after a moment's silence.  Again Mr. Moore tapped.  Would they never  open the door!  Laboriously he rolled in the direction of succor.  If  he could get his back against the door he could then tap upon its base,  when surely he must be heard.  The knocking was repeated a little  louder, and finally a voice called:  "Mr. Jack!"    It was one of the house men--Mr. Moore recognized the fellow's voice.
