"Let us go, Jaska! Keep behind me, right on my heels!"    Slowly, fighting against something that seemed determined to pull, or  hurl, them outward from the surface of the Moon with each forward  movement they made, they essayed the side of the hill, pausing at the  end of what seemed like hours in a sort of hollow just large enough  to mask their bodies and stared over its edge into one of the craters  of the Moon. Out of the depths of that crater came the discordant  sounds, which now were almost deafening, and out of that crater too  came the almost invisibly bluish column whose outer tip touched the  Earth.    *       *       *       *       *    Right before them, so close that they all but rested in its shadow,  was one of those monster aircars, its tentacles moving to and fro as  though wafted into motion by some vagrant breeze.
