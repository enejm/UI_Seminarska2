  "I'd thought of doing that," Jean conceded. "But isn't that a monstrous  way to treat a literary genius?"    "Not at all!" she protested. "By taking on a work that will require more  time than his lifetime, he is defeating himself."    "There's that way of looking at it," agreed the artist. "All right,  Droozle," he called. "You heard us talking and you know we mean it. No  more writing until we reach an agreement--or else!"    Droozle quit writing at once. While the girl and the young artist  watched anxiously, Droozle first wandered about uncertainly for a few  minutes and then curled up on a newspaper and went to sleep.    He slept all evening.    *       *       *       *       *    "He has beaten us again," Jean Lanni told Judy Stokes resignedly when  she arrived at his studio the following evening. He watched Droozle  fascinatedly as the snake moved his restless tail over the margins of  newspapers spread on the floor. "He doesn't know yet that I know. I  discovered the fraud only by the merest accident."    "He isn't writing?" she asked, perusing the newspapers for signs of  Droozle's elegant script.    "He most certainly is."    "Where?"    "Look at him!" Jean exclaimed, ignoring her question. "He's doing it  again!"    Droozle had ceased wriggling for the moment and lay there shaking  violently, as though he had malaria. Then the paroxysm passed and he  took up his restless movements again.    "The poor genius," mourned Judy. "He must be sick with frustration."    "Sick, my eye! That snake has learned to centrifuge part of his blood  while it is in his body, so that the hemoglobin is separated out. The  result is--invisible ink!"    "Why, I'll tell that Droozle off!" raved Judy. "Here I sat feeling sorry  for the little crumb!"    Droozle did not mind. While she ranted, he brazenly began writing in  visible ink once more.
