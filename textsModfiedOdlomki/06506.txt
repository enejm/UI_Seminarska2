  'Of course I do,' and he held out his hand.  'I believe everything out  of the common.  The only thing to distrust is the normal.'    He was very young, but he was the man for my money.    'I think they're off my track for the moment, but I must lie close for  a couple of days.  Can you take me in?'    He caught my elbow in his eagerness and drew me towards the house.  'You can lie as snug here as if you were in a moss-hole.  I'll see that  nobody blabs, either.  And you'll give me some more material about your  adventures?'    As I entered the inn porch I heard from far off the beat of an engine.  There silhouetted against the dusky West was my friend, the monoplane.    He gave me a room at the back of the house, with a fine outlook over  the plateau, and he made me free of his own study, which was stacked  with cheap editions of his favourite authors.  I never saw the  grandmother, so I guessed she was bedridden.  An old woman called  Margit brought me my meals, and the innkeeper was around me at all  hours.  I wanted some time to myself, so I invented a job for him.  He  had a motor-bicycle, and I sent him off next morning for the daily  paper, which usually arrived with the post in the late afternoon.  I  told him to keep his eyes skinned, and make note of any strange figures  he saw, keeping a special sharp look-out for motors and aeroplanes.  Then I sat down in real earnest to Scudder's note-book.    He came back at midday with the SCOTSMAN.  There was nothing in it,  except some further evidence of Paddock and the milkman, and a  repetition of yesterday's statement that the murderer had gone North.  But there was a long article, reprinted from THE TIMES, about Karolides  and the state of affairs in the Balkans, though there was no mention of  any visit to England.  I got rid of the innkeeper for the afternoon,  for I was getting very warm in my search for the cypher.
