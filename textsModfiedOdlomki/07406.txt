  And so it was that when the first fair wind rose he embarked upon his  cruise, and with him he took as strange and fearsome a crew as ever  sailed under a savage master.    Mugambi and Akut went with him, and Sheeta, the panther, and a dozen  great males of the tribe of Akut.          Chapter 6    A Hideous Crew      The war-canoe with its savage load moved slowly toward the break in the  reef through which it must pass to gain the open sea.  Tarzan, Mugambi,  and Akut wielded the paddles, for the shore kept the west wind from the  little sail.    Sheeta crouched in the bow at the ape-man's feet, for it had seemed  best to Tarzan always to keep the wicked beast as far from the other  members of the party as possible, since it would require little or no  provocation to send him at the throat of any than the white man, whom  he evidently now looked upon as his master.    In the stern was Mugambi, and just in front of him squatted Akut, while  between Akut and Tarzan the twelve hairy apes sat upon their haunches,  blinking dubiously this way and that, and now and then turning their  eyes longingly back toward shore.    All went well until the canoe had passed beyond the reef.   Here the  breeze struck the sail, sending the rude craft lunging among the waves  that ran higher and higher as they drew away from the shore.    With the tossing of the boat the apes became panic-stricken.  They  first moved uneasily about, and then commenced grumbling and whining.  With difficulty Akut kept them in hand for a time; but when a  particularly large wave struck the dugout simultaneously with a little  squall of wind their terror broke all bounds, and, leaping to their  feet, they all but overturned the boat before Akut and Tarzan together  could quiet them.  At last calm was restored, and eventually the apes  became accustomed to the strange antics of their craft, after which no  more trouble was experienced with them.
