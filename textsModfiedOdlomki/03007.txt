and supplies--which can only be paid for in Earth dollars--and we can't  export enough to Earth to earn those dollars."    By that time, they were entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar &  Grill, on the 73rd Level. Matheny's jaw clanked down.    "Whassa matter?" asked Doran. "Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic  technician before?"    "Uh, yes, but--well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications."
