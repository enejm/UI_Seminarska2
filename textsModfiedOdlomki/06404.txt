koodoo.  At first I was a complete duffer, and shamed myself in Colin's  eyes.  But by-and-by I learned something of veld-craft: I learned how  to follow spoor, how to allow for the wind, and stalk under cover.  Then, when a shot had crippled the beast, Colin was on its track like a  flash to pull it down.  The dog had the nose of a retriever, the speed  of a greyhound, and the strength of a bull-terrier.  I blessed the day  when the wandering prospector had passed the store.    Colin slept at night at the foot of my bed, and it was he who led me to  make an important discovery.

Wherever I went--on the  road, on the meadows of the plateau, or on the rugged sides of the  Berg--it was the same.  I had silent followers, who betrayed themselves  now and then by the crackling of a branch, and eyes were always looking
