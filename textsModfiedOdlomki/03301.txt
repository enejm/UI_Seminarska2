I hardly recognized the creature that looked  out of the mirror. My lean, square, blunt-nosed face, gray eyes,  and big hands were the same or nearly so. But my black crest had  been replaced with a shock of blond hair, my ears were small and  immobile, my skin a dull bronze, and several of Earth's languages were  hypnotically implanted in my brain--together with a set of habits and  reflexes making up a pseudo-personality which should be immune to any  tests that the rebels could think of.
