Nat's journey with  Madge from the center of the city, in what was the old Borough of  Westchester, to his home in the suburb of Hartford, was a continual  ovation.    Crowds lined the air-route, and every few miles, so thick was the  air-traffic, he was forced to hover and address the cheering  multitudes.
