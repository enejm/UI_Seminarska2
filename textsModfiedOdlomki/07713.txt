received.    D’Artagnan mounted the box, having a pair of pistols in his belt, a  musket under his feet and a naked sword behind him.    The queen appeared, and was followed by the king and the Duke d’Anjou,  his brother.    “Monsieur the coadjutor’s carriage!” she exclaimed, falling back.    “Yes, madame,” said D’Artagnan; “but get in fearlessly, for I myself  will drive you.”    The queen uttered a cry of surprise and entered the carriage, and the  king and monsieur took their places at her side.    “Come, Laporte,” said the queen.    “How, madame!” said the valet, “in the same carriage as your majesties?”    “It is not a matter of royal etiquette this evening, but of the king’s  safety. Get in, Laporte.”    Laporte obeyed.    “Pull down the blinds,” said D’Artagnan.    “But will that not excite suspicion, sir?” asked the queen.    “Your majesty’s mind may be quite at ease,” replied the officer; “I have  my answer ready.”    The blinds were pulled down and they started at a gallop by the Rue  Richelieu. On reaching the gate the captain of the post advanced at the  head of a dozen men, holding a lantern in his hand.    D’Artagnan signed to them to draw near.    “Do you recognize the carriage?” he asked the sergeant.    “No,” replied the latter.    “Look at the arms.”    The sergeant put the lantern near the panel.    “They are those of monsieur le coadjuteur,” he said.    “Hush; he is enjoying a ride with Madame de Guemenee.”    The sergeant began to laugh.    “Open the gate,” he cried. “I know who it is!” Then putting his face to  the lowered blinds, he said:    “I wish you joy, my lord!”    “Impudent fellow!” cried D’Artagnan, “you will get me turned off.”    The gate groaned on its hinges, and D’Artagnan, seeing the way clear,  whipped his horses, who started at a canter, and five minutes later they  had rejoined the cardinal.
