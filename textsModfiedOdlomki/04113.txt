industry--"    I got hold of myself. I smiled my best I-love-children smile. "Doreen,"  I said, "let me look at Elmer's unhappen genii."    The kid clutched the box.    "Elmer told me not to let anybody look at it. He said he'd statuefy me  if I did. He said nobody would understand it anyway. He said he might  show it to Mr. Einstein, but not anybody else."    "That's Elmer, all right," Marge muttered.    I found myself breathing hard. I edged toward Doreen and put my hand on  the hatbox. "Just one quick look, Doreen," I said. "No one will ever  know."    She didn't answer. Just pulled the box away.    I pulled it back.    She pulled.    I pulled.    "Bill--" Marge called warningly. Too late. The lid of the hatbox came  off in my hands.    *       *       *       *       *    There was a bright flash, the smell of insulation burning, and the  unhappen genii fell out and scattered all over the floor.    Doreen looked smug. "Now Elmer will be angry at you. Maybe he'll  disintegrate you. Or paralalize you and statuefy you. Forever."    "He might at that, Bill," Marge shuddered. "I wouldn't put anything past  him."    I wasn't listening. I was scrambling after the mess of tubes, condensers  and power packs scattered over the rug. Some of them were still wired  together, but most of them had broken loose. Elmer was certainly one  heck of a sloppy workman. Hadn't even soldered the connections. Just  twisted the wires together.    I looked at the stuff in my hands. It made as much sense as a radio run  over by a truck.    "We'll take it back to Elmer," I told Doreen, speaking very carefully.  "I'll give him lots of money to build another. He can come down here and  use our shop. We have lots of nice equipment he'd like."
