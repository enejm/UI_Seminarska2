was last seen.    Yet in this thing at least Fortune favoured us, for there was now lying  at Cowes, and ready to sail that night, a Dutch couper that had run a  cargo of Hollands on the other side of the island, and was going back to  Scheveningen freighted with wool. Our landlord knew the Dutch captain  well, having often done business for him, and so could give us letters of  recommendation which would ensure us a passage to the Low Countries. Thus  in the afternoon we were on the road, making our way from Newport to  Cowes in a new disguise, for we had changed our clothes again, and now  wore the common sailor dress of blue.    The clouds had returned after the rain, and the afternoon was wet, and  worse than the morning, so I shall not say anything of another weary and  silent walk. We arrived on Cowes quay by eight in the evening, and found  the couper ready to make sail, and waiting only for the tide to set out.  Her name was the _Gouden Droom_, and she was a little larger than the  _Bonaventure_, but had a smaller crew, and was not near so well found.  Elzevir exchanged a few words with the captain, and gave him the  landlord's letter, and after that they let us come on board, but said  nothing to us. We judged that we were best out of the way, so went below;  and finding her laden deep, and even the cabin full of bales of wool,  flung ourselves on them to rest. I was so tired and heavy with sleep that  my eyes closed almost before I was lain down, and never opened till the  next morning was well advanced.    I shall not say anything about our voyage, nor how we came safe to  Scheveningen, because it has little to do with this story. Elzevir had  settled that we should go to Holland, not only because the couper was  waiting to sail thither for we might doubtless have found other boats  before long to take us elsewhere--but also because he had learned at  Newport that the Hague was the first market in the world for diamonds.
