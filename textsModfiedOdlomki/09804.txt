   It was the she-wolf who had first caught the sound of men's voices and  the whining of the sled-dogs; and it was the she-wolf who was first to  spring away from the cornered man in his circle of dying flame.  The pack  had been loath to forego the kill it had hunted down, and it lingered for  several minutes, making sure of the sounds, and then it, too, sprang away  on the trail made by the she-wolf.    Running at the forefront of the pack was a large grey wolf--one of its  several leaders.  It was he who directed the pack's course on the heels  of the she-wolf.
