nobly and poetically and considerately, and altogether there was  absolutely no excuse for her being in a temper. Still, she was.    The moon, however, considered the affair as arranged.    For she had been no whit more resolute in her refusal, you see, than  becomes any self-respecting maid. In fact, she had not refused him;  and the experienced moon had seen the hopes of many a wooer thrive,  chameleon-like, on answers far less encouraging than that which  Margaret had given Felix Kennaston.    Margaret was very fond of him. All women like a man who can do a  picturesque thing without bothering to consider whether or not he be  making himself ridiculous; and more than once in thinking of him she  had wondered if--perhaps--possibly--some day--?

If no one blames the young Montague for sending  Rosaline to the right-about--Rosaline for whom he was weeping and  rhyming an hour before--why, pray, should not Signorina Capulet have  had a few previous _affaires du coeur_? Depend upon it, she had; for
