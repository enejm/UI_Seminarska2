than, looking back, I saw the pursuit topping the ridge from which I  had descended.    After that I did not look back; I had no time.  I ran up the burnside,  crawling over the open places, and for a large part wading in the  shallow stream.  I found a deserted cottage with a row of phantom  peat-stacks and an overgrown garden.  Then I was among young hay, and  very soon had come to the edge of a plantation of wind-blown firs.  From there I saw the chimneys of the house smoking a few hundred yards  to my left.  I forsook the burnside, crossed another dyke, and almost  before I knew was on a rough lawn.  A glance back told me that I was  well out of sight of the pursuit, which had not yet passed the first  lift of the moor.    The lawn was a very rough place, cut with a scythe instead of a mower,  and planted with beds of scrubby rhododendrons.  A brace of black-game,  which are not usually garden birds, rose at my approach.  The house  before me was the ordinary moorland farm, with a more pretentious  whitewashed wing added.  Attached to this wing was a glass veranda, and  through the glass I saw the face of an elderly gentleman meekly  watching me.    I stalked over the border of coarse hill gravel and entered the open  veranda door.  Within was a pleasant room, glass on one side, and on  the other a mass of books.  More books showed in an inner room.  On the  floor, instead of tables, stood cases such as you see in a museum,  filled with coins and queer stone implements.    There was a knee-hole desk in the middle, and seated at it, with some  papers and open volumes before him, was the benevolent old gentleman.  His face was round and shiny, like Mr Pickwick's, big glasses were  stuck on the end of his nose, and the top of his head was as bright and  bare as a glass bottle.  He never moved when I entered, but raised his  placid eyebrows and waited on me to speak.
