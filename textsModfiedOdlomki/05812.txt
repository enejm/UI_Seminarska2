always worked toward.    "Please, will you kill me?" the Zen said.    *       *       *       *       *    I'd been expecting that. Two years ago, on the bleak surface of Eros,  Yurt had asked Engstrom to do the same thing. But I asked, "Why?"  although I knew what the answer would be, too.    The Zen looked up at me.
