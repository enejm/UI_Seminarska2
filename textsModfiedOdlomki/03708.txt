 Is that correct?"    "Could be. Suppose we get options, or leases on these pieces ..."    "That was a good phrase," Evin broke in unexpectedly. "Don't you think  so, Robert?"    "Yes!" Robert said sharply. He seemed to have suddenly lost his smile.  He gave Evin a hard look from under down-drawn brows. He turned to  Muldoon. "We are renting this, this tumbledown structure. A two-year  lease. H'mm! I see your point. Spending millions in a sudden buying move  would make unneeded difficulties. No! Options to buy, but lease for the  present.
