 once you get accustomed to the realities of life--see if you don't.  Heigh-ho the wind and the rain!"    The snake shuddered.    "Careful, you'll centrifuge," Judy warned.    Jean added reflectively, studying the ceiling, "Day by day, month by  month, year by year, the reality of everyday existence etches deeply  into our consciousness, if we will but have the fortitude to expose  ourselves to it."    Droozle unavoidably centrifuged this time, but did manage, with  laborious lateral movements, to mix the hemoglobin back with the plasma  again.    He complained, "It is cruel of you to condemn me to this ugliness. I  want only to read my books and hear a few simple fugues by Bach."    "It is not cruel. You will have exactly the same existence I have chosen  for myself as an artist. It is fundamental that if you are to write  serious literature, you must rub your nose against the realities of  life."    Droozle wriggled unhappily for a moment. Finally he wrote, "Actually my  writing may not be as serious as the title implies. Misunderstandings  conceivably arise over titles. Instead of _The Rise and Fall of the  Western Plainsman_, how about changing it to _Those Lowdown Scaly  Rustlers_?"    "That's really getting down to earth," cried Jean, concealing his  elation. "But if you aren't going to write serious literature, who will  I get to go on my painting trips with me?"    "Take that female of yours," suggested Droozle. "If she refuses to go,  inform her that we shall be forced to hand her over to the dog catcher."    "Do you suppose he means that?" wondered Jean.    "Of course not, silly," said Judy, bright-eyed. "He's only negotiating."      --FRANK BANTA      [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy December 1962.
