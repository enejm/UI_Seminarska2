literary personages of that hour wherein these pages were written--will  inevitably have come to savor somewhat of antiquity: so that sundry  references herein to the "vital" books now most in vogue will rouse  much that vague shrugging recollection as wakens, say, at a mention of  _Dorothy Vernon_ or _Three Weeks_ or _Beverly of Graustark_.  And while  at first glance it might seem expedient--in revising the last  proof-sheets of these pages--somewhat to "freshen them up" by  substituting, for the books herein referred to, the "vital" and more  widely talked-of novels of the summer of 1916, the task would be but  wasted labor; since even these fascinating chronicles, one comprehends  forlornly, must needs be equally obsolete by the time these  proof-sheets have been made into a volume.  With malice aforethought,  therefore, the books and authors named herein stay those which all of  three years back our reviewers and advertising pages, with perfect  gravity, acclaimed as of enduring importance.  For the quaintness of  that opinion, nowadays, may profitably round the moral that there is  really nothing whereto one may fittingly compare a successful  contribution to "vital" reading-matter, as touches evanescence.    And this is as it should be.  _Tout passe.--L'art robust seul a  l'éternité_, precisely as Gautier points out, with bracing  common-sense; and it is excellent thus to comprehend that to-day, as  always, only through exercise of the auctorial virtues of distinction  and clarity, of beauty and symmetry, of tenderness and truth and  urbanity, may a man in reason attempt to insure his books against  oblivion's voracity.    Yet the desire to write perfectly of beautiful happenings is, as the  saying runs, old as the hills--and as immortal.  Questionless, there  was many a serviceable brick wasted in Nineveh because finicky persons  must needs be deleting here and there a phrase in favor of its cuneatic  synonym; and it is not improbable that when the outworn sun expires in  clinkers its final ray will gild such zealots tinkering with their  "style."  This, then, is the conclusion of the whole matter.  Some few  there must be in every age and every land of whom life claims nothing  very insistently save that they write perfectly of beautiful
