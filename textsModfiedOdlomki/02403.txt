  "Be calm, Aña, and tell me plainly."    Still clinging to him, she went on. "He told me that Aimu is a devil,  Hale. He showed me his hands and asked me if I could ever get used to  them and be--his squaw." The round gold breastplates and the necklace of  painted seeds clinked together over her panting bosom.

Dragging Aña after him, Hale dashed  forward, conscious of two masculine voices raised in passion.    The door to the room where the life-machine performed its vile work was
