sing. There was the trill of a canary with the sun on its cage. There  was the song of the thrush, the mocking-bird and the meadow lark. These  blended finally into a melodious burst of chirping melody which seemed a  chorus of the wild birds of the forest and glen. Then the lilting love  measure again. It tore at the heart strings, and brought tears to one's  eyes.    Unconsciously the girl next to Jenks leaned towards him. Involuntarily  he leaned to meet her. Their shoulders touched. The cloud of her golden  hair came to rest against his dark locks. Their hands found each other  with gentle pressure. Both were lost to the world.    Abruptly the music changed. There was a succession of broken treble  notes that sounded like the crackling of flames. Moans deep and  melancholy followed. These grew more strident and prolonged, giving  place to abject howls, suggesting the lamentations of the damned.    The hands of the boy and girl gripped tensely. They could not help  shuddering.    The violin began to produce notes of a leering, jeering character,  growing more horrible with each measure until they burst in a loud  guffaw of maniacal laughter.    The whole performance was as if someone had taken a heaven and plunged  it into a hell.    The musician bowed jerkily, and was gone.    *       *       *       *       *    There was no applause, only wild exclamations. Half the house was on its  feet. The other half sat as if glued to chairs.    The boy and the girl were standing, their hands still gripping tensely.    "Come, let's get out of here," said Jenks. The girl took her wrap and  Jenks helped her into it. Hand in hand they fled the place.    In the lobby their eyes met, and for the first time they realized they  were strangers. Yet deep in their hearts was a feeling that their fates  had been sealed.
