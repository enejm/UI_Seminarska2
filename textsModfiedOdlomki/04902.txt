  "But how was I to get the news?" asked Simkins, with some indignation.  The editor shrugged his shoulders. That was not his part of the  business; and if the Anarchists chose to make things uncomfortable for  the young man, he could not help it.    Simkins' fellow-lodger, a student who was studying chemistry in London,  noticed that the reporter was becoming gaunt with anxiety.    "Simkins," said Sedlitz to him one morning, "you are haggard and  careworn: what is the matter with you? Are you in love, or is it merely  debt that is bothering you?"    "Neither," replied Simkins.    "Then cheer up," said Sedlitz. "If one or the other is not interfering  with you, anything else is easily remedied."

Let me give  them a lecture on the Chemistry of Anarchy. It's a fascinating  subject."    "What good would that do?"    "Oh, wait till you have heard the lecture. If I don't make the hair of  some of them stand on end, they are braver men than I take them to be.  We have a large room in Clement's Inn, where we students meet to try  experiments and smoke tobacco. It is half club, and half a lecture-  room. Now, I propose to get those Anarchists in there, lock the doors,
