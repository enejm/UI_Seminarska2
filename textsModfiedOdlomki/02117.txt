the beetle commander, went over the ship. The insect was evidently  amused at Jim and was determined to find out the limits of his  intelligence, for he pointed out various controls and motors of the ship  and made elaborate sketches which Jim seemed to comprehend fairly well.    *       *       *       *       *    One of the beetles approached the control board and motioned me back. I  stepped away from the board; evidently a port in the side of the vessel  opened, for I felt a breath of air and could hear the hum of the city. I  walked to the side and glanced down, and found that we were floating  about twenty feet off the ground over a street on the edge of the city.  On the street a short distance ahead of us two children, evidently  returning from school, to judge by the books under their arms, were  walking unsuspectingly along. A turn of the dial sped up our motors, and  as the hum rang out in a louder key the children looked upward. Two of  the long flexible wires shot out and wrapped themselves about the  children; screaming, they were lifted into the space flyer. The port  through which they came in shut with a clang and the ship rose rapidly  into the air. The children were released from the wires which coiled  themselves up on deck and the beetle who had operated them stepped  forward and grasped the nearer of the children, a boy of about eleven,  by the arm. He raised the boy, who was paralyzed with terror, up toward  his head and gazed steadily into his eyes. Slowly the boy ceased  struggling and became white and rigid. The beetle laid him on the deck  and turned to the girl. Involuntarily I gave a shout and sprang forward,  but Jim grasped me by the arm.    "Keep quiet, you darned fool!" he cried. "We can do nothing now. Wait  for a chance!"    "We can't stand here and see murder done!" I protested.
