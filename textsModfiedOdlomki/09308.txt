   “The Baas called me,” he said when it was drawing to his satisfaction,  “what does Baas want of Hans?”    “Light in darkness!” I replied, playing on his native name, and  proceeded to set out the whole case to him.    He listened without a word, then asked for a small glass of gin, which  I gave him doubtfully. Having swallowed this at a gulp as though it were  water, he delivered himself briefly to this effect:    “I think the Baas will do well not to go to Kilwa, since it means  waiting for a ship, or hiring one; also there may be more slave-traders  there by now who will bear him no love because of a lesson he taught  them a while ago. On the other hand the road through Zululand is open,  though it be long, and there the name of Macumazana is one well known.  I think also that the Baas would do well not to take too many men, who  make marching slow, only a wagon or two and some drivers which might be  sent back when they can go no farther. From Zululand messengers can be  dispatched to the Mazitu, who love you, and Bausi or whoever is king  there to-day will order bearers to meet us on the road, until which time  we can hire other bearers in Zululand. The old woman at Beza-Town told  me, moreover, as you will remember, that the Kendah are a very great  people who live by themselves and will allow none to enter their land,  which is bordered by deserts. Therefore no force that you could take  with you and feed upon a road without water would be strong enough to  knock down their gates like an elephant, and it seems better that you  should try to creep through them like a wise snake, although they appear  to be shut in your face. Perhaps also they will not be shut since did  you not say that two of their great doctors promised to meet you and  guide you through them?”    “Yes,” I interrupted, “I dare say it will be easier to get in than to  get out of Kendahland.”
