  "But can't you let me stay, now that I'm here?" urged Larry. "I know  something about boats. I'll serve as a member of the crew--anything."    "Impossible. We have a full complement. You would be more of a  hindrance than a help. Besides, I do not care to have the possible  results of this expedition blared before the public."    "I'll write nothing you do not approve."    "I have no time to edit your writings, young man. My own, will occupy  me sufficiently. So it is useless. You are only wasting your  breath--and mine."    He motioned for his officers to carry out his orders.    But before they could move to do so, in strode a lean, middle-aged  Norwegian Larry sensed must be Captain Petersen himself, and on his  weathered face was an expression of such gravity that it was obvious  to everyone something serious had happened.    *       *       *       *       *    Ignoring Larry, after one brief look of inquiry that was answered by  Professor Stevens, he reported swiftly what he had to say.    While cruising full speed at forty fathoms, with kite-aerial out,  their wireless operator had received a radio warning to turn back.  Answering on its call-length, he had demanded to know the sender and  the reason for the message, but the information had been declined, the  warning merely being repeated.    "Was it a land station or a ship at sea?" asked the professor.    "Evidently the latter," was the reply. "By our radio range-finder, we  determined the position at approximately latitude 27, longitude 65."    "But that, Captain, is in the very area we are headed for."    "And that, Professor, makes it all the more singular."    "But--well, well! This is indeed peculiar! And I had been on the point  of turning back with our impetuous young stowaway. What would you  suggest, sir?"    Captain Petersen meditated, while Larry held his breath.
