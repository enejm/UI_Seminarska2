returned Dorothy was awake. Then the three held a counsel to decide what  they should do next, but could think of no way to better their  condition.    "I don't like these veg'table people," said the little girl. "They're  cold and flabby, like cabbages, in spite of their prettiness."    "I agree with you. It is because there is no warm blood in them,"  remarked the Wizard.    "And they have no hearts; so they can't love anyone--not even  themselves," declared the boy.    "The Princess is lovely to look at," continued Dorothy, thoughtfully;  "but I don't care much for her, after all. If there was any other place  to go, I'd like to go there."    "But _is_ there any other place?" asked the Wizard.    "I don't know," she answered.    Just then they heard the big voice of Jim the cab-horse calling to them,  and going to the doorway leading to the dome they found the Princess and  a throng of her people had entered the House of the Sorcerer.    So they went down to greet the beautiful vegetable lady, who said to  them:    "I have been talking with my advisors about you meat people, and we have  decided that you do not belong in the Land of the Mangaboos and must not  remain here."    "How can we go away?" asked Dorothy.    "Oh, you cannot go away, of course; so you must be destroyed," was the  answer.    "In what way?" enquired the Wizard.    "We shall throw you three people into the Garden of the Twining Vines,"  said the Princess, "and they will soon crush you and devour your bodies  to make themselves grow bigger. The animals you have with you we will  drive to the mountains and put into the Black Pit. Then our country will  be rid of all its unwelcome visitors."    "But you are in need of a Sorcerer," said the Wizard, "and not one of  those growing is yet ripe enough to pick. I am greater than any  thorn-covered sorcerer that ever grew in your garden. Why destroy me?"
