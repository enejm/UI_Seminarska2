   And upon this sublime reflection, Porthos pressed his friend’s hand  cordially.    In presence of this ingenuous greatness of soul, Aramis felt his own  littleness. It was the second time he had been compelled to bend before  real superiority of heart, which is more imposing than brilliancy of  mind. He replied by a mute and energetic pressure to the endearment of  his friend.    “Now,” said Porthos, “that we have come to an explanation, now that I am  perfectly aware of our situation with respect to Louis XIV., I think, my  friend, it is time to make me comprehend the political intrigue of which  we are the victims--for I plainly see there is a political intrigue at  the bottom of all this.”    “D’Artagnan, my good Porthos, D’Artagnan is coming, and will detail it  to you in all its circumstances; but, excuse me, I am deeply grieved, I  am bowed down with mental anguish, and I have need of all my presence  of mind, all my powers of reflection, to extricate you from the false  position in which I have so imprudently involved you; but nothing can be  more clear, nothing more plain, than your position, henceforth. The king  Louis XIV. has no longer now but one enemy: that enemy is myself,  myself alone. I have made you a prisoner, you have followed me, to-day  I liberate you, you fly back to your prince. You can perceive, Porthos,  there is not one difficulty in all this.”    “Do you think so?” said Porthos.    “I am quite sure of it.”    “Then why,” said the admirable good sense of Porthos, “then why, if  we are in such an easy position, why, my friend, do we prepare cannon,  muskets, and engines of all sorts? It seems to me it would be much  more simple to say to Captain d’Artagnan: ‘My dear friend, we have been  mistaken; that error is to be repaired; open the door to us, let us pass  through, and we will say good-bye.’”    “Ah! that!” said Aramis, shaking his head.    “Why do you say ‘that’? Do you not approve of my plan, my friend?”
