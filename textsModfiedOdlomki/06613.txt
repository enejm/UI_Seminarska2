  We had to trust to Peter's instinct.  I asked him where our line lay,  and he sat very still for a minute sniffing the air.  Then he pointed  the direction.  It wasn't what I would have taken myself, but on a  point like that he was pretty near infallible.    Presently we came to a long slope which cheered me.  But at the top  there was no light visible anywhere--only a black void like the inside  of a shell.  As I stared into the gloom it seemed to me that there were  patches of deeper darkness that might be woods.    'There is a house half-left in front of us,' said Peter.    I peered till my eyes ached and saw nothing.    'Well, for heaven's sake, guide me to it,' I said, and with Peter in  front we set off down the hill.    It was a wild journey, for darkness clung as close to us as a vest.  Twice we stepped into patches of bog, and once my horse saved himself  by a hair from going head forward into a gravel pit.  We got tangled up  in strands of wire, and often found ourselves rubbing our noses against  tree trunks.  Several times I had to get down and make a gap in  barricades of loose stones.  But after a ridiculous amount of slipping  and stumbling we finally struck what seemed the level of a road, and a  piece of special darkness in front which turned out to be a high wall.    I argued that all mortal walls had doors, so we set to groping along  it, and presently found a gap.

We dismounted now, leading our horses, and after about fifty yards the  path ceased and came out on a well-made carriage drive. So, at least,  we guessed, for the place was as black as pitch.
