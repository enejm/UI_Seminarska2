  "You're still a St. Bernard," said Bonnie.    "The devil with it then," said the dog. "Let's forget all about it."    The dog took one last lap of serum. _Pop!_ Bobby got up from the floor  and dejectedly started out the back door. Bonnie skipped after him.    "What'll we do now, Bob?" she asked.    "We'll go down to Thrifty's and get some ice cream."    They walked down the hill silently, Bobby brooding over not having  been a leopard and Bonnie wishing he had stayed a St. Bernard. As they  approached the main street of the small town, Bonnie turned to her  brother.    "You want to make some more of that stuff tomorrow?"    "Not the same stuff," said Bob.    "What'll we make instead?"    "I ain't decided yet."    "You want to make an atomic bomb?"    "Maybe."    "Can we do it in the juicer?"    "Sure," Bob said, "only we'll have to get a couple of onions."
