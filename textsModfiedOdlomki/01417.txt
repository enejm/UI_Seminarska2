[Illustration: High School Course in Two Years!]      You Want to Earn Big Money!    =And you will not be satisfied unless you earn steady promotion.= But  are you prepared for the job ahead of you? Do you measure up to the  standard that insures success? For a more responsible position a fairly  good education is necessary. To write a sensible business letter, to  prepare estimates, to figure cost and to compute interest, you must have  a certain amount of preparation. All this you must be able to do before  you will earn promotion.    Many business houses hire no men whose general knowledge is not equal to  a high school course. Why? Because big business refuses to burden itself  with men who are barred from promotion by the lack of elementary  education.      Can You Qualify for a Better Position    We have a plan whereby you can. We can give you a complete but  simplified high school course in two years, giving you all the  essentials that form the foundation of practical business. It will  prepare you to hold your own where competition is keen and exacting. Do  not doubt your ability, but make up your mind to it and you will soon  have the requirements that will bring you success and big money. YOU CAN  DO IT.    Let us show you how to get on the road to success. It will not cost you  a single working hour. Write today. It costs you nothing but a stamp.      American School
