But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a  customary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed  chips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple  courtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the  feel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.    "I say!" he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the  green table. "I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules."    "You did all right, brother," said a middle-aged lady with an obviously  surgical bodice.    "But--I mean--when do we start actually _playing_? What happened to the  cocked dice?"    *       *       *       *       *    The lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. "Sir!  This is a church!"    "Oh--I see--excuse me, I, I, I--" Matheny backed out of the crowd,  shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.    "You forgot your chips, pal," said a voice.    "Oh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I, I, that is--" Matheny cursed  his knotting tongue. _Damn it, just because they're so much more  sophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler?_    The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and  sleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell  cloak and curly-toed slippers.    "You're from Mars, aren't you?" he asked in the friendliest tone  Matheny had yet heard.    "Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I--" He stuck out his  hand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. "Damn! Oh, excuse me, I  forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want  to g-g-get the hell out of here."    "Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft."    Matheny sighed. "A drink is what I need the very most."
