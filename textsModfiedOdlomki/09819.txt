White Fang left the chicken for the man.  A club might have stopped White  Fang, but not a whip.  Silently, without flinching, he took a second cut  in his forward rush, and as he leaped for the throat the groom cried out,  "My God!" and staggered backward.  He dropped the whip and shielded his  throat with his arms.  In consequence, his forearm was ripped open to the  bone.    The man was badly frightened.  It was not so much White Fang's ferocity  as it was his silence that unnerved the groom.  Still protecting his  throat and face with his torn and bleeding arm, he tried to retreat to  the barn.  And it would have gone hard with him had not Collie appeared  on the scene.  As she had saved Dick's life, she now saved the groom's.  She rushed upon White Fang in frenzied wrath.  She had been right.  She  had known better than the blundering gods.  All her suspicions were  justified.  Here was the ancient marauder up to his old tricks again.    The groom escaped into the stables, and White Fang backed away before  Collie's wicked teeth, or presented his shoulder to them and circled  round and round.  But Collie did not give over, as was her wont, after a  decent interval of chastisement.  On the contrary, she grew more excited  and angry every moment, until, in the end, White Fang flung dignity to  the winds and frankly fled away from her across the fields.    "He'll learn to leave chickens alone," the master said.  "But I can't  give him the lesson until I catch him in the act."    Two nights later came the act, but on a more generous scale than the  master had anticipated.  White Fang had observed closely the  chicken-yards and the habits of the chickens.  In the night-time, after  they had gone to roost, he climbed to the top of a pile of newly hauled  lumber.  From there he gained the roof of a chicken-house, passed over  the ridgepole and dropped to the ground inside.  A moment later he was  inside the house, and the slaughter began.
