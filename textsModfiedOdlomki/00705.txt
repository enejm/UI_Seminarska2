Ozma dear!"      "How do you like it, Dorothy?" inquired the Patchwork Girl.    "Is it good poetry, Scraps?" asked Dorothy, doubtfully.    "It's as good as any ordinary song," was the reply.  "I have given it a  dandy title, too.  I shall call the song: 'When Ozma Has a Birthday,  Everybody's Sure to Be Gay, for She Cannot Help the Fact That She Was  Born.'"    "That's a pretty long title, Scraps," said Dorothy.    "That makes it stylish," replied the Patchwork Girl, turning a  somersault and alighting on one stuffed foot. "Now-a-days the titles  are sometimes longer than the songs."    Dorothy left her and walked slowly toward the place, where she met the  Tin Woodman just going up the front steps.    "What are you going to give Ozma on her birthday?" she asked.    "It's a secret, but I'll tell you," replied the Tin Woodman, who was  Emperor of the Winkies.  "I am having my people make Ozma a lovely  girdle set with beautiful tin nuggets.  Each tin nugget will be  surrounded by a circle of emeralds, just to set it off to good  advantage.  The clasp of the girdle will be pure tin!  Won't that be  fine?"    "I'm sure she'll like it," said Dorothy.  "Do you know what I can give  her?"    "I haven't the slightest idea, Dorothy.  It took me three months to  think of my own present for Ozma."    The girl walked thoughtfully around to the back of the palace, and  presently came upon the famous Scarecrow of Oz, who has having two of  the palace servants stuff his legs with fresh straw.    "What are you going to give Ozma on her birthday?" asked Dorothy.    "I want to surprise her," answered the Scarecrow.    "I won't tell," promised Dorothy.    "Well, I'm having some straw slippers made for her--all straw, mind  you, and braided very artistically.  Ozma has always admired my straw  filling, so I'm sure she'll be pleased with these lovely straw  slippers."
