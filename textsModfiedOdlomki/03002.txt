 The gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected.  Three generations on Mars might lengthen the legs and expand the chest  a trifle, but the genes had come from Earth and the organism readjusts.  What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had  apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen  through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by  Earth's. The passport official seemed to bellow at him.    "Pardon me for asking this.

But I would advise you to leave the  capital and get into the sticks--um, I mean the provinces. I am sure  there must be tolerably competent sales executives in Russia or  Congolese Belgium or such regions. Frankly, sir, I do not believe you  can attract anyone out of Newer York."    "Thanks," said Matheny, "but, you see, I--we need--that is.... Oh,
