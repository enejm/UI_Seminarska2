 the door because of long habit, and again sat down on the couch. After  the door closed, he and Phil listened to her sure footsteps going down  the corridor. They looked at one another a little guardedly.    "You know I'm on your side," Farley said when they could no longer hear  Katherine's footsteps. "Surely you know I don't like this any more than  you do, Phil."    "I suppose you don't."    "You won't mind very much if I ask you a favor, will you?" Farley  said. Having asked a rhetorical question, he seemed to be illogically  waiting for an answer. Phil was unaware of the chess game, but wondered  uneasily what was coming.    "Will you please leave her alone?" Farley said.    "I--" Phil started to say, but Farley held his hand up, palm forward.    "My dear chap, you are one of the most sensitive and kind people I  know. But you are a little thoughtless. You imagine that, because  Katherine is blind, you are doing her a favor by--by giving her  companionship. You feel that her interest in the world can be furthered  by your interest in her. This is not the case. I ask you please to  leave us alone."    "Us?"    "Yes. You put me in the embarrassing position of having to say that  we are very well as we are. I know that Katherine is impressed by  your--your mind, and I know that your sympathy is well-intended, but it  is misplaced. She needs no sympathy."    "Why not?"    Doctor Farley spread his hands, a gesture usually meant to substitute  for words. "Do the strong need sympathy?"    "I think so," Phil said.    Doctor Farley smiled. "Well, then, think of _me_ as the strong one--the  one who needs sympathy as the guardian of something precious. Will you  give me your sympathy?" He smiled still.    Phil realized that when the A.E.C. man came--when any pretext presented  itself--Doctor Farley would throw him to the wolves.    "Katherine is not in love with me," Phil said.    "But are you with her?"
