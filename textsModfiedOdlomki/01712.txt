But down in the Earthglow at the crater-base, Miko's lights had not  vanished! I had missed! An error in the range? Abruptly I knew it was  not that. Miko's lights were still there. His signals still coming.  And I remarked now a faint distortion about them, the glow of his  little group of hand-lights faintly distorted and vaguely shot with a  greenish cast. Benson curve-lights! I realized it.    My thoughts whirled in the few seconds while I stood there at the  tower window. Miko had feared he might summarily be fired upon. He had  gone back to his camp, equipped all his lights with the Benson curve.  He was somewhere at the crater-base now. But not where I thought I saw  him!
