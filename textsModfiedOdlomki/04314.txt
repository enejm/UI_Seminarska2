We are hovering at five hundred feet. I can actually see the white  edge of the sea beating at the cliff. Mr. Yardo keeps making small  corrections; there is a wind out there trying to blow us away. It is  cloudy here: I can see neither moons nor stars.    Mr. Yardo checks the radio. Nothing yet.    I stare downwards and fancy I can see a metallic gleam.    Then there is a wordless shout from Mr. Yardo; a bright dot hurtles  across the screen and at the same time I see a streak of blue flame  tearing diagonally downwards a hundred feet away.
