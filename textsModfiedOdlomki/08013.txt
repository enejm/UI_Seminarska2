“But by what extraordinary chance did it happen that you were at the  hotel when the affiliated travelers met together?”    “Oh!” said Aramis, in a calm voice, “it was the merest chance in the  world. I was going to Fontainebleau to see M. Fouquet, for the purpose  of obtaining an audience of the king. I was passing by, unknown; I saw  the poor dying monk in the road, and recognized him immediately. You  know the rest--he died in my arms.”    “Yes; but bequeathing to you so vast a power that you issue your  sovereign orders and directions like a monarch.”    “He certainly did leave me a few commissions to settle.”    “And what for me?”    “I have told you--a sum of twelve thousand livres was to be paid to  you. I thought I had given you the necessary signature to enable you to  receive it. Did you not get the money?”    “Oh! yes, yes. You give your orders, I am informed, with so much  mystery, and such a majestic presence, that it is generally believed you  are the successor of the defunct chief.”    Aramis colored impatiently, and the duchesse continued: “I have obtained  my information,” she said, “from the king of Spain himself; and he  cleared up some of my doubts on the point. Every general of the Jesuits  is nominated by him, and must be a Spaniard, according to the statutes  of the order. You are not a Spaniard, nor have you been nominated by the  king of Spain.”    Aramis did not reply to this remark, except to say, “You see, duchesse,  how greatly you were mistaken, since the king of Spain told you that.”    “Yes, my dear Aramis; but there was something else which I have been  thinking of.”    “What is that?”    “You know, I believe, something about most things, and it occurred to me  that you know the Spanish language.”    “Every Frenchman who has been actively engaged in the Fronde knows  Spanish.”    “You have lived in Flanders?”    “Three years.”    “And have stayed at Madrid?”
