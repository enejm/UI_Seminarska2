north and south. Besides Carnes and the doctor, the car held two men  from the Bureau. As they climbed out, Carnes saw that one of them  carried a portable radio sending set, while the other bore an  electroscope and a rubber rod. The radio operator set up his device,  while the other man rubbed his coat sleeve briskly with the hard  rubber and then touched the ball of the electroscope with it. The two  bits of gold-leaf spread out.    "While we're waiting, I'll explain something of this to you, Carnes,"  said the doctor. "At four hundred-yard intervals are men with  electroscopes like this one. My attempt to locate Saranoff by means of  wave detectors was a failure. That proved that the ray he was using is  not of the wave type. The other common ray is the cathode ray type  which does not consist of vibrations but of a stream of electrons,  negative particles of electricity, traveling in straight lines of high  velocity. He must be knocking loose some of the electrons when he  collapses the atoms. The rate of discharge of these electroscopes will  give us a clue to the nearness of his device."    *       *       *       *       *    "Once you locate him, how do you propose to attack him?"    "The obvious method, that of using his own ray against him, fell down.  However, in attempting to produce it, I stumbled on another weapon  which may be equally effective. I am going to try to use an exact  opposite of his ray. The cathode ray, when properly used, will bombard  the atoms and knock electrons loose. I perfected last night a device  on which I have been working for months. It is a super-cathode ray. I  tested it on the yellow powder and find that I can successfully  reverse Saranoff's process. He can contract matter together until it  occupies less than one one-thousandth of its original volume. My ray  will destroy this effect and restore matter to something like its  original condition."
