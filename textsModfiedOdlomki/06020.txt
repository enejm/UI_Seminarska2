the first.    "They're already looking for you," I said. "Which shows how little  chance I would have had of getting to you openly. You'd better be going  now."    But as I led them to the door I knew I had to make one more attempt.    "Professor Copperd, do you think there might still be hope? We of Venus  can offer much to Earth."    "Maybe there _is_ hope," he said, and he looked brighter than I had ever  seen him look. "I was reaching the point where I had no faith in the  future. But now, knowing that you have solved the problems which we  face.... Perhaps, if the proper arrangements were made.... But you would  be risking a great deal to return. And I can assure you that for a long  time Venus will be safe. So you have no reason--"    "I have a good reason for coming back," I interrupted. Taking Beth by  the shoulders, I swung her about to face me.    "I love you," I said. "I started out to trick you and ended by loving  you."    Then her arms were about me and her lips were on mine. I felt my face  wet with her tears, and I knew that my love was returned. There were  still problems to face, dangers to overcome, but they didn't matter.    "It may be a year," I said. "Perhaps two years."    "I'll be waiting. I'll be standing here, waiting for you."    Now the sirens were very close and there were searchlights sweeping the  fields and the woods. I watched Beth and her father walking away and  then I closed the door. I should have felt sad, but I didn't. A year or  two weren't much. On this planet far from my own, I was leaving my  heart, and I would return one day to redeem it.
