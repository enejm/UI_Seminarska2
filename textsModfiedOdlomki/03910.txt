Bobby said, "Because that's what you do with experiments, stupid."    "But, Bob, it smells like garbage."    "Medicine smells worse and it makes you healthy," Bob said, while  stirring the pot with an old wooden spoon.    Bonnie held her nose, stood on tiptoe and looked in at the cooking  solution. "Will this make us healthy?"    "Maybe." Bob kept stirring.    "What will it do?"    "You'll see." Bob took two clean dish towels, draped them around the  pot and carried it over to the formica kitchen table.
