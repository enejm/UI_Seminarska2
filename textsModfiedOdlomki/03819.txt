almost leave the floor. I grin through my helmet at Wurpz.    The sub keeps purring and purring. The altimeter registers four thousand  feet. It is a caution, an altimeter in a sub. Two hours later we shoot  out through a hole deep under the coast of Brazil and I know we are in  the ocean as the monitor shows some old wrecked ships about three miles  from us. We disconnect the Subterro anti-bends kimonos and peel them  off. Agrodyte Hitler is moving two of his arms when we climb toward the  surface.    "Hah, we will make a sucker out of history," I says to Wurpz. "And wait  until we show this creep to Professor Zalpha and Exmud R. Zmorro."    We come to the surface and contact an Earthian Franco-Austro atomic  luxury liner. The skipper's pan registers on the viso-screen. "This is  Septimus Spink," I says.

The universe goes into a cosmic dither when we slide into a berth in  Hampton Rhodus. Thousands of citizens hail us as we ride to Metropolita  in a Supercaddijet.
