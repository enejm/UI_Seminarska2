  "Interesting eh?" A voice broke through his cataleptic trance and the  other answered: "Beautiful; almost a classical case. Great plasticity of  imagination." "Yes; that's exactly what sets me wondering; the fellow  should have cracked up by all the rules of the game." "How do we know  that he hasn't? Maybe he was psycho and they didn't notice; they had  some godawful asses for psychiatrists in war medicine. It's quite a  possibility; well, his image production is ebbing now; I don't expect  anything new of significance, what do you think?" "Now; we've got what  we wanted anyway. Let's take him out of it; but go easy on the  rheostats."    The projector stopped. The masterful, the ghostly fingers which had been  playing on the keyboard of his mind very slowly receded from a furious  fortissimo to a pianissimo. At first only the flutterings of the  diaphragm eased, then the violent palpitations of a foreign pulse  slipped off the heart; the liberated lungs expanded; tremors were  running through the body as through the ice of a frozen river at spring;  and then at last the mind escaped from its captivity.    *       *       *       *       *    Gradually as in a cinema after the show the lights reappeared. Blinking,  Lee stared at the man who stood over him taking his pulse; it was Bondy.  Mellish stood at the foot of the table with his back to Lee; he seemed  to watch some apparatus which made noises like a teletype machine.  Swinging his legs off the table Lee said:    "I'm okay; you needn't hold my hand."    But then he noticed that he wasn't. His head spun, his whole body was  wet with perspiration, he felt very weak and limp. He swayed and buried  his face in his hands trying to gain his balance, trying to shake off  the trance. "Excuse me," he said. "I'm a bit dizzy."    As he opened his eyes again the two medics were standing right in front  of him and smiling down on him with their bland, professional smiles.
