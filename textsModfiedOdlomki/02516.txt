WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE    The attack comes without warning; its reason is unknown. But Venus is  approaching the earth, and flashes from the planet are followed by  terrific explosions that wreak havoc throughout the world. Lieutenant  McGuire and Captain Blake of the U. S. Army Air Service see a great  ship fly in from space. Blake attacks it with the 91st Squadron in  support, and Blake alone survives. McGuire and Professor Sykes, an  astronomer of Mount Lawson, are captured.
