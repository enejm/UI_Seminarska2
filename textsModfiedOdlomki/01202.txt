  I was silent, and rather awed. The sight was so unexpectedly grand and  eerie; though this latter quality came more upon me later.    Presently, I looked up and across to the further side of the chasm.  There, I saw something towering up among the spray: it looked like a  fragment of a great ruin, and I touched Tonnison on the shoulder. He  glanced 'round, with a start, and I pointed toward the thing. His gaze  followed my finger, and his eyes lighted up with a sudden flash of  excitement, as the object came within his field of view.    "Come along," he shouted above the uproar. "We'll have a look at it.  There's something queer about this place; I feel it in my bones." And he  started off, 'round the edge of the craterlike abyss. As we neared this  new thing, I saw that I had not been mistaken in my first impression. It  was undoubtedly a portion of some ruined building; yet now I made out  that it was not built upon the edge of the chasm itself, as I had at  first supposed; but perched almost at the extreme end of a huge spur of  rock that jutted out some fifty or sixty feet over the abyss. In fact,  the jagged mass of ruin was literally suspended in midair.    Arriving opposite it, we walked out on to the projecting arm of rock,  and I must confess to having felt an intolerable sense of terror as I  looked down from that dizzy perch into the unknown depths below us--into  the deeps from which there rose ever the thunder of the falling water  and the shroud of rising spray.    Reaching the ruin, we clambered 'round it cautiously, and, on the  further side, came upon a mass of fallen stones and rubble. The ruin  itself seemed to me, as I proceeded now to examine it minutely, to be a  portion of the outer wall of some prodigious structure, it was so thick  and substantially built; yet what it was doing in such a position I  could by no means conjecture. Where was the rest of the house, or  castle, or whatever there had been?
