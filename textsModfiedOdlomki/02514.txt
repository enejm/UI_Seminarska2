But that was the second day of the work upon our own world, and just  before sunset there was a droning in the earthly sky above the  laboratory, and Tommy ran out, and somebody shot at him from a patch  of woodland a quarter of a mile away from the brick building. Isolated  as Denham's place was, the shot would go unnoticed. The bullet passed  within a few feet of Tommy, but he paid no attention. It was one of  Jacaro's watchers, no doubt, but Jacaro did not want Tommy killed. So  Tommy waited until the plane swooped low--almost to the level of the  laboratory roof--and a thickly padded package thudded to the ground.  He picked it up and darted back into the laboratory as other bullets  came from the patch of woodland.    "Funny," he said dryly to Smithers, inside the laboratory again; "they  don't dare kill me--yet--and Von Holtz doesn't dare leave or refuse to  do what I tell him to do; and yet they expect to lick us."    Smithers growled. Tommy was unpacking the wrapped package. A grim,  blued-steel thing came out of much padding. Boxes tumbled after it.    "Sub-machine gun," said Tommy, "and ammunition. Jacaro and his little  pals will try to get in here when they think we've got the big  solenoid ready for use. They'll try to get it before we can use it.  This will attend to them."    "An' get us in jail," said Smithers calmly, "for forty-'leven years."    "No," said Tommy, and grinned. "We'll be in the fifth dimension. Our  job is to fling through the catapult all the stuff we'll need to make  another catapult to fling us back again."    "It can't be done," said Smithers flatly.    "Maybe not," agreed Tommy, "especially since we ruin all our springs  and one gymbal ring every time we use the thing. But I've got an idea.  I'll want five coils with hollow iron cores, and the whole works  shaped like this, with two holes bored so...."    *       *       *       *       *
