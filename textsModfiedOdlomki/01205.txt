brought in contact with something superhumanly foul; something  unholy--belonging to some hitherto undreamt of state of existence.    I cannot say that I grasped these various details of the brute at the  time. I think they seemed to come back to me, afterward, as though  imprinted upon my brain. I imagined more than I saw as I looked at the  thing, and the material details grew upon me later.    For perhaps a minute I stared at the creature; then as my nerves  steadied a little I shook off the vague alarm that held me, and took a  step toward the window.
