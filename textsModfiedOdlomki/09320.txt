 “Oh! George, that dreadful brute,” and she pointed to the dead elephant,  “has killed our baby. Look at it! Look at it! We must be everything to  each other now, dear, as we were before it came--unless God sends us  another.”    Then she burst into a flood of weeping and fell into his arms, after  which I turned away. So, to their honour be it said, did the Kendah,  leaving the pair alone behind the bulk of dead Jana.    Here I may state two things: first, that Lady Ragnall, whose bodily  health had remained perfect throughout, entirely recovered her reason  from that moment. It was as though on the shattering of the Ivory Child  some spell had been lifted off her.
