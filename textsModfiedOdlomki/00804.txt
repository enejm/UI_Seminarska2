 chopped-out mouth, and shook a few grains of the powder off its back. The  rest of the powder seemed to have vanished into the body of the horse.    "Good!" called Jack, while the boy looked on in astonishment. "You are a  very clever sorcerer, dear father!"    Line-Art Drawing        46               Full page line-art drawing.        47               The Awakening of the Saw-horse      The Saw-Horse, finding himself alive, seemed even more astonished than Tip.  He rolled his knotty eyes from side to side, taking a first wondering view  of the world in which he had now so important an existence. Then he tried to  look at himself; but he had, indeed, no neck to turn; so that in the  endeavor to see his body he kept circling around and around, without  catching even a glimpse of it. His legs were stiff and awkward, for there  were no knee-joints in them; so that presently he bumped against Jack  Pumpkinhead and sent that personage tumbling upon the moss that lined the  roadside.        48    Tip became alarmed at this accident, as well as at the persistence of the  Saw-Horse in prancing around in a circle; so he called out:    "Whoa! Whoa, there!"    The Saw-Horse paid no attention whatever to this command, and the next  instant brought one of his wooden legs down upon Tip's foot so forcibly that  the boy danced away in pain to a safer distance, from where he again yelled:    "Whoa! Whoa, I say!"    Jack had now managed to raise himself to a sitting position, and he looked  at the Saw-Horse with much interest.    "I don't believe the animal can hear you," he remarked.    "I shout loud enough, don't I?" answered Tip, angrily.    "Yes; but the horse has no ears," said the smiling Pumpkinhead.
