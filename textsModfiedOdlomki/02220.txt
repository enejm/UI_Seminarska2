  Your magazine is undoubtedly the best Science Fiction "mag"  on the stands. Why? Because of your authors. There is not  another Science Fiction book on the stands that has stories  by Victor Rousseau, Murray Leinster Ray Cummings, A. T.  Locke, A. J. Burks, C. W. Diffin, S. W. Ellis and many  others.    Some of your readers want stories by Dr. David H. Keller, Ed  Earl Repp and Walter Kately. Well, I just wanted to tell you  that I have stopped reading all other Science Fiction "mags"  on account of the frequency of these authors in them. So  please, please, don't destroy my last stronghold.    Also, I would not be against reprints. There is only one so  far who has objected to reprints, while there have been  several asking you to reprint A. Merritt's "People of the  Pit." It would not only satisfy your present readers, but,  because of the great popularity of A. Merritt among the  reading circles of to-day, it would gain for you many more  readers.    Harl Vincent is an indispensable acquisition to "our"  magazine. His stories are not only all excellent but his  stories all contain good science. He will bring you many new  readers.    May I add my voice to every other reader's in the cry for  the reprinting of "People of the Pit," by A. Merritt? Why  not give us some stories by him? He's pretty near the best  writer living to-day.
