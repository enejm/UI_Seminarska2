 hopeless task. Of course if you can get it back to 75,000 words the  digest magazines will have no trouble shrinking it to 15,000 words or  fifteen pictures, and you then get your fingers in the till." He paused  and all hope fled from his face. "Droozle won't live nearly long enough  to get all of that shrinking done. And in the meantime that scribbling  snake is writing me out of house and home!"    "Are you going to let him get away with it?" the girl challenged.    *       *       *       *       *    "I don't know whether I am or not," replied the young artist, looking  worried. "I thought I had the problem solved at first. He got so sassy  when we were arguing about him writing classics that I had no hesitation  about applying a pinch of glue to his glittering little extremity. That  put him out of the writing business until he came to terms."    "Well, now. You _were_ enterprising!" she approved.    "It didn't do any good though," Jean grumbled despondently, bowing his  head.    "He wouldn't bargain?" she asked incredulously.    "He didn't have to. He knew right where the cheese grater was."    "Ooh!"    "My sentiments exactly. But I don't know what to do with him now."    "You're all out of ideas?"    "Oh we could sell this house and move down to skid row where the rents  are cheap," he flung out airily, but quite plainly worried sick.    "I've got a much better idea than that," she said cheerily, getting a  pad and pencil from her red handbag. "How about giving Droozle this  ultimatum?" As she wrote, Jean read over her shoulder, "'Suggest you  begin writing fiction pleasing both to you and your master, or we shall  be forced to hand you over to the dog catcher!'"    Jean drew back amazed. "Why, we would do no such thing!"    "I know it, silly. I'm just negotiating."
