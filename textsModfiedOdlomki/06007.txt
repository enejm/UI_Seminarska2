and then picks up that swimmer and throws him fifty feet without the  slightest effort ... well, that man is slightly unusual, to say the  least."    "Oh, the swimming...."    I hadn't thought that what was quite ordinary for me might seem exactly  the opposite to these people. I had blundered. So I tried to shrug it  off, as though such things were common among my people. Which they were.  But that line only dragged me deeper. This girl was no fool.    "That's what I meant, Marko. You aren't being modest. You're acting as  though you're used to such feats, and take them as a matter of course.  And there's your accent. I can't quite place it."    "Some day I'll tell you all about it," I said lightly. "When we know  each other better."    "That's going pretty fast, isn't it?"    "Some of us have found that we don't have all the time we should like.  We must go fast, or not at all."    It was a platitude, slightly jumbled, but none the less true. Beth was  looking up at me. There were things she might have noticed; that my skin  was uncommonly smooth, and that I hadn't even the faintest trace of  whiskers.    She didn't notice those things. She was looking into my eyes. I found  myself enjoying this experience.    "Will you come in for a while?" she asked slowly.    I relaxed. Everything was all right, for the present. She was taking me  at face value. She liked me and I liked her. The operation was  proceeding smoothly.    We walked into a large room, pleasantly furnished. On a couch opposite  the doorway three men sat talking. Two others stood before them. The  moment we entered, the conversation stopped abruptly.    "Beth?" said a tall, graying man. He was already stuffing papers into a  bag. "Back so soon?"    He wasn't really listening for a reply and Beth didn't make one. When he  had the papers in the bag he locked it, then snapped it around his wrist  and put the key in his pocket.
