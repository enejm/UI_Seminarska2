consumed much more rapidly than if they merely struck thin  air.    That, however, is a minor point and I wouldn't even mind  conceding it to Mr. Meek. The point I now wish to make is  much more important and in my mind establishes the falsity  of Mr. Meek's premises. In the July issue of Astounding  Stories, page seven, paragraph four, sentences fourteen and  fifteen, he states that the Heaviside Layer is composed of a  liquid of high viscosity. By definition a liquid is more  dense than a gas. Therefore the Heaviside Layer, according  to Mr. Meek, is denser than the atmosphere of the earth  since the former is a liquid and the latter is a gas. The  increased refraction of light as it entered our atmosphere  would then be noticeable. Astronomers can even now detect  refraction due to the air. The sun remains visible for some  time after it has actually descended below the horizon, due  to refraction. If there was a denser substance than air  surrounding the earth the refraction would be much greater.  Finally, how could the atmosphere support a denser substance  like the Heaviside Layer? I'd sure make for cover if I  really believed that such a menace existed right over my  head.    Sorry to take up your space so much by an argument, but your  comments on my letter really called for a defense. Hope you  can find room for this.--Philip Waite, 3400 Wayne Ave, New  Your, N. Y.
