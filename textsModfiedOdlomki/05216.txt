 Their triumph had so far been a matter of but sixty seconds. The jangle  of the alarm bell continued ominously. It summoned resistance,  well-trained resistance; the defenses of the asteroid awoke to action.  Doors spacing the corridor behind now began to open, releasing dozens of  Orientals. Nor had these men heard Ku Sui's orders. They would shoot to  kill!    *      *      *      *      *    Three peering faces suddenly were in Hawk Carse's line of vision ahead:  three ray-guns were settling on him. His famous left hand, the gun-hand  that was known and dreaded throughout space, moved with the eye-blinding  speed that was necessary; his trigger finger bent only three times, but  each of the pencil-thin streaks of orange that spat forth brought down a  man, and he had struck without slackening his stride for an instant.    Twice more his ray-gun spoke, and then the goal, the entrance to the  central laboratory, was just ahead. Carse glanced back.    "Yes, suh!" a fierce voice yelled out to him. "Coming!"    Friday was bringing up the rear as fast as he could. He came sideways in  a zigzag course ducking and whirling constantly, and in between firing  promptly at any portions of enemy anatomies that dared project into the  line of the corridor. The Hawk covered the last few yards of his  retreat, and then they were together at the laboratory.    "The knob!" Carse ordered, spraying the corridor in general warning.    Friday tried it, but the door was locked. He hurled himself against it,  but it did not budge.    How to get through? On the other side of the door was Leithgow, and  probably Ku Sui; on this side they were trapped in a blind end. They  could never make it back down that gauntlet and live, and anything like  concerted action on the part of the yellows would do for them where they  were.
