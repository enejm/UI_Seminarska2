XXIII  Taken Alive  XXIV  The Messenger of Death  XXV  Home  Glossary            1    The Pithecanthropus    Silent as the shadows through which he moved, the great beast slunk  through the midnight jungle, his yellow-green eyes round and staring,  his sinewy tail undulating behind him, his head lowered and flattened,  and every muscle vibrant to the thrill of the hunt. The jungle moon  dappled an occasional clearing which the great cat was always careful  to avoid. Though he moved through thick verdure across a carpet of  innumerable twigs, broken branches, and leaves, his passing gave forth  no sound that might have been apprehended by dull human ears.    Apparently less cautious was the hunted thing moving even as silently  as the lion a hundred paces ahead of the tawny carnivore, for instead  of skirting the moon-splashed natural clearings it passed directly  across them, and by the tortuous record of its spoor it might indeed be  guessed that it sought these avenues of least resistance, as well it  might, since, unlike its grim stalker, it walked erect upon two  feet--it walked upon two feet and was hairless except for a black  thatch upon its head; its arms were well shaped and muscular; its hands  powerful and slender with long tapering fingers and thumbs reaching  almost to the first joint of the index fingers.
