brought him a steaming bowl of soup, which the horse eyed in dismay.    "Take that stuff away!" he commanded. "Do you take me for a  salamander?"    They obeyed at once, and next served a fine large turbot on a silver  platter, with drawn gravey poured over it.    "Fish!" cried Jim, with a sniff. "Do you take me for a tom-cat? Away  with it!"    The servants were a little discouraged, but soon they brought in a great  tray containing two dozen nicely roasted quail on toast.    "Well, well!" said the horse, now thoroughly provoked. "Do you take me  for a weasel? How stupid and ignorant you are, in the Land of Oz, and  what dreadful things you feed upon! Is there nothing that is decent to  eat in this palace?"    The trembling servants sent for the Royal Steward, who came in haste and  said:    "What would your Highness like for dinner?"    "Highness!" repeated Jim, who was unused to such titles.    "You are at least six feet high, and that is higher than any other  animal in this country," said the Steward.    "Well, my Highness would like some oats," declared the horse.    "Oats? We have no whole oats," the Steward replied, with much  defference. "But there is any quantity of oatmeal, which we often cook  for breakfast. Oatmeal is a breakfast dish," added the Steward, humbly.    "I'll make it a dinner dish," said Jim. "Fetch it on, but don't cook it,  as you value your life."    You see, the respect shown the worn-out old cab-horse made him a little  arrogant, and he forgot he was a guest, never having been treated  otherwise than as a servant since the day he was born, until his arrival  in the Land of Oz. But the royal attendants did not heed the animal's  ill temper. They soon mixed a tub of oatmeal with a little water, and  Jim ate it with much relish.    Then the servants heaped a lot of rugs upon the floor and the old horse  slept on the softest bed he had ever known in his life.
