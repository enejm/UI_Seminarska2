subtitle Ten Years Later. These two titles are also given to different  volumes: The Vicomte de Bragelonne can refer to the whole book, or the  first volume of the three or four-volume editions. Ten Years Later  can, similarly, refer to the whole book, or the second volume of the  four-volume edition. To add to the confusion, in the case of our etexts,  it refers to the first 104 chapters of the whole book, covering material  in the first and second etexts in the new series. Here is a guide to the  series which may prove helpful:    The Three Musketeers: Etext 1257--First book of the D’Artagnan Romances.  Covers the years 1625-1628.    Twenty Years After: Etext 1259--Second book of the D’Artagnan Romances.  Covers the years 1648-1649. [Third in the order that we published, but  second in time sequence!!!]    Ten Years Later: Etext 1258--First 104 chapters of the third book of the  D’Artagnan Romances. Covers the years 1660-1661.    The Vicomte de Bragelonne: Etext 2609 (first in the new series)--First  75 chapters of the third book of the D’Artagnan Romances. Covers the  year 1660.    Ten Years Later: Etext 2681 (our new etext)--Chapters 76-140 of that  third book of the D’Artagnan Romances. Covers the years 1660-1661. [In  this particular editing of it]    Louise de la Valliere: forthcoming (our next etext)--Chapters 141-208 of  the third book of the D’Artagnan Romances. Covers the year 1661.    The Man in the Iron Mask: forthcoming (following)--Chapters 209-269 of  the third book of the D’Artagnan Romances. Covers the years 1661-1673.    If we’ve calculated correctly, that fourth text SHOULD correspond to  the modern editions of The Man in the Iron Mask, which is still  widely circulated, and comprises about the last 1/4 of The Vicomte de  Bragelonne.
