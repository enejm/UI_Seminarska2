man to be suspected. I have a keen appreciation for the irony of fate!  White would have died the night before, Dale, except that I lacked the  courage to kill him. His murderer was standing, under my power, outside  his very house--and then I suddenly thought it best that I should have  an alibi. Your Scotland Yard is clever, and it was best that I have  protection. And so, on the following night, I sent Sir John to the house  once again. This time, while I sat here and controlled the actions of my  puppet, a group of men sat here with me. They believed that I was  experimenting with a new type of radio receiver!"    *       *       *       *       *    Michael Strange laughed, laughed harshly, in utter triumph, as a cat  laughs at the antics of his mouse victims.    "When that murder was done," he said, "I sent Margot to the scene, so  that she might see her lover strangled, dead. I repeat, Dale, that I  enjoy the irony of fate, especially when I can control it.

When you leave here, you will  be unharmed--but after the exhibition I shall give you, I am sure that  you will make no further attempt to interfere with things out of your  realm of understanding."

Strange's recital had revealed to me  the horrible lust that gripped him, and now I watched him in  fascination. He would not harm the girl; that much I was sure of. In his  distorted fashion he loved her. In his crazed, murderous way he would  attempt to win her love, even though she had once scorned him.    *       *       *       *       *
