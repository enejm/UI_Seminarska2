Oh, where have you been, charming Billy?"    And Billy's baritone answered her:    "I've been to seek a wife--"    and broke off in a groan.    "Good Lord!" said Mr. Woods.    It was a ludicrous business, if you will. Indeed, it was vastly  humorous--was it not?--this woman's thinking a man's love might by any  chance endure through six whole years. But their love endures, you  see; and the silly creatures have a superstition among them that love  is a sacred thing, stronger than time, victorious over death itself.

Kennaston she pitied a little; but his bearing toward  her ranged ludicrously from that of proprietorship to that of  supplication, and, moreover, she was furious with him for having  hinted at various times that Billy was a fortune-hunter.    Margaret was quite confident by this that she had never believed  him--"not really, you know"--having argued the point out at some
