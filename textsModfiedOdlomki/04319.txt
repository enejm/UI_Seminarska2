  I forgot about the hopper come to that, there seemed to be nothing in  the world except me and the stretcher and the enemy.    Stretcher.    I say, "Is M'Clare--"    At which moment Mr. Yardo turns from the controls with a wide smile of  triumph and says "Eighteen twenty-seven, girls!" and the world goes  weightless and swings upside down.    Then still with no sense of any time-lapse I am lying in the big  lighted hold, with the sound of trampling all round: it is somehow  filtered and far off and despite the lights there seems to be a globe  of darkness around my head. I hear my own voice repeating, "M'Clare?  How's M'Clare?"    A voice says distantly, without emphasis, "M'Clare? He's dead."    The next time I come round it is dark. I am vaguely aware of having  been unconscious for quite a while.    There is a single thread of knowledge connecting this moment with the  last: M'Clare's dead.    This is the central factor: I seem to have been debating it with  myself for a very long time.    I suppose the truth is simply that the Universe never guarantees  anything; life, or permanence, or that your best will be good enough.    The rule is that you have to pick yourself up and go on; and lying  here in the dark is not doing it.    I turn on my side and see a cluster of self-luminous objects including  a light switch. I reach for it.    How did I get into a hospital?    On second thoughts it is a cabin in the ship, or rather two of them  with the partition torn out, I can see the ragged edge of it. There is  a lot of paraphernalia around; I climb out to have a look.    Holy horrors what's happened? Someone borrowed my legs and put them  back wrong; my eyes also are not functioning well, the light is set at  Minimum and I am still dazzled. I see a door and make for it to get  Explanations from somebody.
