Your artists are great, but you could still improve by  having them make a full page illustration at the start and  one more exciting one as the story progresses.    Well, I think I've said enough good things about you and  enough suggestions, so until January 1932, adios, au revoir,  etc.--Henry Benner, Cowithe, Wash.      _Ouch!_    Dear Editor:    Personally I would rather read a good short story than the  ten pages of instructions by Readers published in the March  issue. Two pages are plenty, especially when half the  criticisms concern paper, size, edges of paper, etc. A. S.  is O. K!    How about that other short?--Don Ward, 6 Ketchel St.,  Auburn, N. Y.      _Likes Action_    Dear Editor:    I have just finished the February issue of Astounding  Stories. All of the stories were so good I couldn't tell you  which one is the best. "The Phalanxes of Atlans" and "The  Tentacles from Below" were very good. I liked "The Black  Lamp," too. It is up to the standard of the rest of the Dr.  Bird stories. "The Pirate Planet" ended very beautifully.  However, I did not like that about Sykes getting killed.  "Werewolves of War" was good. It ended differently from most  of the other stories. Most of them end with the hero  escaping, but in this the hero was killed. It had a very  good plot.
