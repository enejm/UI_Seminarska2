 What if it had a wife and family living in that cave, every one of them  thirsting for vengeance?    Well, it was too late to hesitate now, but secretly I hoped that one  of the others would prefer to lead the way. We reached the place and  listened. It was silent as a tomb. Then that brave fellow Hans lit the  lantern and said:    “Do you stop here, Baases, while I go to look. If you hear anything  happen to me, you will have time to run away,” words that made me feel  somewhat ashamed of myself.    However, knowing that he was quick as a weasel and silent as a cat,  we let him go. A minute or two later suddenly he reappeared out of the  darkness, for he had turned the metal shield over the bull’s-eye of the  lantern, and even in that light I could see that he was grinning.    “It is all right, Baas,” he said. “The Father of Serpents has really  gone to that land whither he sent Bena, where no doubt he is now  roasting in the fires of hell, and I don’t see any others. Come and look  at him.”    So in we went and there, true enough, upon the floor of the cave lay the  huge reptile stone dead and already much swollen. I don’t know how long  it was, for part of its body was twisted into coils, so I will only say  that it was by far the most enormous snake that I have ever seen. It is  true that I have heard of such reptiles in different parts of  Africa, but hitherto I had always put them down as fabulous creatures  transformed into and worshipped as local gods. Also this particular  specimen was, I presume, of a new variety, since, according to Ragnall,  it both struck like the cobra or the adder, and crushed like the  boa-constrictor. It is possible, however, that he was mistaken on this  point; I do not know, since I had no time, or indeed inclination, to  examine its head for the poison fangs, and when next I passed that way  it was gone.
