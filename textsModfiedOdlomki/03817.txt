Hitler Number Three says, "that we purify the air every few seconds with  formula XYB and Three-fifth. The basis of the gas is galena."    I nudge Wurpz and Zahooli as the Neofeuhrer goes over to converse with  his crew. "It is our big chance," I whisper. "You watch how they run  this tub for the next few minutes. Then when I cough three times you be  ready. I do not know how much powder it will take to knock off the big  bug as he is half human. Once I blow this insect powder at the same time  as the purifying blast is to take place, you two be ready to jump  Agrodyte. I noticed that a small purple light flashes on over the  monitor just before that stuff turns loose. It is a warning so the  beetleheads can take deep breaths."    "Sep," D'Ambrosia Zahooli says. "I take back all the insults of the past  five hours. Shake."    "I am doin' that already," I says. "We have to work fast while we are in  the underground river."    We wait. The Neofeuhrer comes walking back to where we are sitting. The  purple light flashes on, and I count to three. Just as the blast of air  loaded with XYB plus cuts loose I throw all the bug powder left in the  box into the current. Hitler Number Three breathes in a big gob of it  and buckles a little at the knees.    "Grab him!" I screech. "Don't let him yank that disintegrator loose. Hit  him with anything you see, pals!"    I see the other beetleheads collapse like they had been hit with  bulldozers and I know now that insecticide is more dangerous in Subterro  than all the radioactivity harnessed up on six planets.    Agrodyte Hitler, however, has some moxey left in him as he has two of  his hands around Wurpz's throat, the third around Zahooli's leg and is  reaching for a ray Betsy with his fourth. He grabs the disintegrator  just as I belt him over his ugly noggin with a wrench about two feet  long and which was certainly not made of aluminum or balsa wood.
