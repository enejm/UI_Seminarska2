   "_Snyder!_" He made it a curse. "Remember what you told me about him  before?"    "I felt different then," she whispered. "He's a wonderful man when you  get to know him."    _And rich._ He suppressed the words and the thought. "What's so  wonderful specifically?" he asked.    "He--" Briefly, her face was rapt.
