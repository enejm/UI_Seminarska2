have replied to their ultimatum and have told them we will have our  answer ready within the appointed time, but it is already agreed between  the nations of the World Alliance that our reply is to be negative.  Better far that we submit to the utter destruction of our civilization  than agree to their terms."    "I believe I can do it, Mr. Secretary," was Hart Jones' simple comment.  "At least I will try. But you must let me have an experienced astronomer  at once with whom to consult."    "Astronomer?"    "Yes--immediately. I have a theory, but am not enough of a student of  astronomy myself to work it out."    "You shall have the best man in the Air Naval Observatory at once."  Secretary Simler chewed his cigar savagely. "And anything else you might  need," he concluded.    "There is nothing else, sir." Hart turned from the great men who  regarded him solemnly, some with expressions of hope, others with plain  distrust written large on their countenances.    *       *       *       *       *    They left in silence and we returned to our work with renewed vigor.  Within an hour there arrived by fast plane an undersized,  thick-spectacled man who presented himself as Professor Linquist  from the government observatory. He was immediately taken into the  office by Hart and the two remained behind closed doors for the best  part of four hours.    Meanwhile the hangar hummed with activity as usual. We in the chemical  laboratory were engaged in compounding the high explosive used as fuel  in the _Pioneer_. This was being compressed to its absolute limit and  was stored in long steel cylinders in the form of a liquid of extremely  low temperature. These cylinders were at once transferred to a special  steel vault where the temperature was kept at a low enough point to  prevent expansion and consequent loss of the explosive, not to speak of  the danger of destroying the entire lot of us in its escape.
