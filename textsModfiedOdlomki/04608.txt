 procured legal authority to prospect the planet for metals, of which  they found a good deal, but they told no one on Zur of this. What  they did mention was the crude oil and natural gas they discovered  in the underlayers of the planet's crust. Crews of Zurians, working  under supervision of the Earthmen, laid pipelines from the gas and oil  regions to every major and minor city on Zur.    *       *       *       *       *    By the time ten years had passed since the landing of the first  terrestrial ship, the Earthmen were conducting a brisk business in  gas-fired ranges, furnaces and heaters ... and the Masur stove business  was gone. Moreover, the Earthmen sold the Zurians their own natural gas  at a nice profit and everybody was happy with the situation except the  brothers Masur.    The drastic steps of the brothers applied, therefore, to making an  energetic protest to the governor of Lor.    At one edge of the city, an area had been turned over to the Earthmen  for a spaceport, and the great terrestrial spaceships came to it and  departed from it at regular intervals. As the heirs of the House of  Masur walked by on their way to see the governor, Zotul observed that  much new building was taking place and wondered what it was.    "Some new devilment of the Earthmen, you can be sure," said Koltan  blackly.    In fact, the Earthmen were building an assembly plant for radio  receiving sets. The ship now standing on its fins upon the apron was  loaded with printed circuits, resistors, variable condensers and other  radio parts. This was Earth's first step toward flooding Zur with the  natural follow-up in its campaign of advertising--radio programs--with  commercials.    Happily for the brothers, they did not understand this at the time or  they would surely have gone back to be buried in their own clay.    "I think," the governor told them, "that you gentlemen have not
