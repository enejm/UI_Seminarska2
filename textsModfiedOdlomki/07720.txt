   “Yes.”    “Without accident?”    “Perfectly safe and sound.”    “Porthos, whilst I get up, watch the cardinal. No, I don’t want your  help, watch the cardinal.”    “I am watching,” said Porthos. “Well?”    “You are right; it is more difficult than I thought. Lend me your  back--but don’t let the cardinal go.”    Porthos lent him his back and D’Artagnan was soon on the summit of the  wall, where he seated himself.
