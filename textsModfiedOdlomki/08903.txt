quiet. Oh, yes, let him curse away, I’ll put him out presently. Look  now, white man.”    I looked, and in the eastern sky there grew a cloud. At first it was  small, though very black, but it gathered with extraordinary rapidity.    This was odd enough, but as I had seen the same thing happen before it  did not particularly astonish me. It is by no means unusual in Africa  for two thunderstorms to come up at the same time from different points  of the compass.    “You had better get on, Indaba-zimbi,” I said, “the big storm is coming  along fast, and will soon eat up that baby of yours,” and I pointed to  the west.    “Babies sometimes grow to giants, white man,” said Indaba-zimbi,  beckoning away vigorously. “Look now at my cloud-child.”    I looked; the eastern storm was spreading itself from earth to sky, and  in shape resembled an enormous man. There was its head, its shoulders,  and its legs; yes, it was like a huge giant travelling across the  heavens. The light of the setting sun escaping from beneath the lower  edge of the western storm shot across the intervening space in a sheet  of splendour, and, lighting upon the advancing figure of cloud, wrapped  its middle in hues of glory too wonderful to be described; but beneath  and above this glowing belt his feet and head were black as jet.  Presently, as I watched, an awful flash of light shot from the head of  the cloud, circled it about as though with a crown of living fire, and  vanished.    “Aha,” chuckled old Indaba-zimbi, “my little boy is putting on his man’s  ring,” and he tapped the gum ring on his own head, which natives assume  when they reach a certain age and dignity. “Now, white man, unless you  are a bigger wizard than either of us you had better clear off, for the  fire-fight is about to begin.”    I thought this sound advice.    “Good luck go with you, my black uncle,” I said. “I hope you don’t feel  the iniquities of a mis-spent life weighing on you at the last.”
