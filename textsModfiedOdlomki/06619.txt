Sleep, my lord, for there is wild work before us.'    I did not sleep much, for I was strung too high with expectation, and I  envied Blenkiron his now eupeptic slumbers.  But for an hour or so I  dropped off, and my old nightmare came back.  Once again I was in the  throat of a pass, hotly pursued, straining for some sanctuary which I  knew I must reach.  But I was no longer alone. Others were with me: how  many I could not tell, for when I tried to see their faces they  dissolved in mist.
