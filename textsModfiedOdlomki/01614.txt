   All so abnormal, irrational, disturbing to human senses. With the mining  work over, an irritability grew upon Grantline's men. And perhaps since  the human mind is so wonderful, elusive a thing, there lay upon these  men an indefinable sense of impending disaster. Johnny Grantline felt  it. He thought about it now as he sat in the room corner watching Wilks  being forced into the plaget-game, and he found it strong within him.  Unreasonable, ominous depression! Barring the accident which had  disabled his little space-ship when they reached this small crater hole,  his expedition had gone well. His instruments, and the information he  had from the former explorers, had picked up the ore-vein with a scant  month of search.    *       *       *       *       *    The vein had now been exhausted; but the treasure was here. Nothing was  left but to wait for the _Planetara_. The men were talking of that now.    "She ought to be well mid-way from here to Ferrok-Shahn by now. When do  you figure she'll be back here, and signal us?"    "Twenty days. Give her another five now to Mars, and five in port.  That's ten. We'll pick her signals in three weeks, mark me."    "Three weeks! Just give me three weeks of reasonable sunrise and sunset!  This cursed Moon! You mean, Williams, next daylight."    "Hah! He's inventing a Lunar language. You'll be a Moon-man yet, if you  live here long enough."    Olaf Swenson, the big blond fellow from the Scandia fiords, came and  flung himself down by Grantline.    "Ay tank they bane without not enough to do, Commander. If the ore yust  would not give out--"    "Three weeks--it isn't very long, Ollie."    "No. Maybe not."    From across the room somebody was saying, "If the _Comet_ hadn't smashed  on us, damn me but I'd ask the Commander to let some of us take her  back. The discarded equipment could go."
