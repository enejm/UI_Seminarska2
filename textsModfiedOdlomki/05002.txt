 Q. The car?    A. Yes, their hot-rod. When we got outside, they acted the way  teen-agers do and went too fast. They were sore at those  spies--they took it out on the car, so it went off the road. It  turned over three times and we were all killed.    Q. They were not spies. They were acting on their own.    A. _I_ didn't know that. I just knew something was funny. Anyway,  how can you say that? They're a waste. And it would have been part  of you, just as I am. It was more of a waste if I hadn't been  split. The other part was only about eleven years old and I had to  wait another six years to--    Q. It is your own fault if you were split. You cannot blame us.  This has happened before--you have aimed badly and arrived wrong.  Don't forget about the help.    A. Well, in this case it's a lucky thing I did; otherwise the whole  thing would have been wasted. And the kelp--that was dreadfully  dull. I wanted to try a really primitive form, but not _that_  primitive. Then I got washed up and it led to the cat. After  they got the iodine out of the kelp, I was suddenly a cat.    Q. This has not been reported.    A. I'm reporting it now. It wasn't dull in the least, but they were  very superstitious about cats in those days, and they decided I was  possessed.    Q. They saw through you?    A. Oh, yes. People usually do.
