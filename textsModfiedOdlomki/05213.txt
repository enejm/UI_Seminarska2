  Dr. Ku Sui smiled deprecatingly and again shrugged.    "I have told you before that God helps those who help themselves. I have  always had splendid results from helping myself."    For a moment he looked away as he considered something in his mind. Then  to his veiled eyes came the old mocking irony, and he said:    "I think perhaps you'd like to observe the operations, my friend, and  I'm going to allow you to. Not here--no. I could never have you  interrupting; the series of operations is of infinite delicacy and will  require weeks. But I can make other arrangements; I can give you as good  as ringside seats for each performance. A small visi-screen might be  attached to one wall of your cell to enable you to see every detail of  what transpires here." His tone suddenly stiffened. "_I wouldn't,  Carse!_"    The Hawk relaxed from the brink on which he had wavered. A sudden mad  rush--what else remained? What else? For an instant he had lost his  head--one of the several times in his whole life. Just for an instant he  had forgotten his phenomenal patience under torture, his own axiom that  in every tight place there was a way out.    "That's much safer," said Ku Sui. "Perhaps you and the black had better  return to your cell."    Certain little muscles in the Hawk's face were trembling as he turned to  go, and his feet would not work well. The ray-guns of the coolie-guards  covered his every move. Friday followed just behind.    As the adventurer came to the door he stopped and turned, and his eyes  went back to those of the frail, elderly scientist.    The doomed man met the gray eyes and their agony with a smile.    "It's all right, old comrade," he said. "Just remember to destroy this  hellish device, if you ever possibly can. My love to Sandra; and to her,  and my dear ones on Earth, anything but the truth.... Farewell."    Carse's fingernails bit each one into his palms. He hesitated; tried,  but could not speak.    "All right, Carse--you may go."
