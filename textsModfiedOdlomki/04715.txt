  Jean turned staunchly to the girl. "Judy, he has convinced me. I have  been wrong about him. From now on _he can write whatever he likes_!"    "Good-by to our hopes then?"    "For the present, yes," assented Jean stoically, as he brought fresh  sheets of paper from his desk for Droozle. "My landscapes might begin to  sell after a while," he added without conviction.    "Rotten little crumb," Judy fumed, glaring balefully at the snake. But  Droozle wrote serenely on, his ruby eyes glowing enigmatically.    Jean interposed magnanimously, "I see now that I have been inexcusably  selfish with Droozle. I've kept him cooped up here, not wanting to  bother with him while I was out on my painting trips. True, he was busy  writing. But most of his knowledge of Earth has come from books; he  can't write classics about living things unless he sees living things."    *       *       *       *       *    As she picked up his trend of thought, Judy's face lost its resentful  expression, and something like seraphic righteousness spread over it. "I  see what you mean. Just how did you plan to make up for this shut-in  feeling that poor Droozle must have been suffering so much from for all  these years?"    "Oh, Judy, I'm so glad you asked me!" He threw wide his arms to the  world. "_Out_ into the wind and the rain we shall go, and there I will  draw my pictures while he observes; then _into_ the roaring, brawling  taverns we shall go, where life thrives in all its abundance. I've been  robbing him by shutting him up here."    "Jean, look at Droozle," the girl exclaimed, pointing. "He has stopped  in the middle of a page and is starting on a fresh one."    Droozle wrote, "Please not out into the wind and the rain. Please not  into the roaring, brawling taverns where life thrives in all its  abundance. I _loathe_ shudder and tilt."
