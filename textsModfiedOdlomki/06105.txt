angle, Peter?"    "The ship. I want to see how heavily shielded that dump-cell is."    "It isn't shielded at all," Anderton's voice said behind me. I hadn't  heard him come in. "But that doesn't prove anything. The egg might have  carried sufficient shielding in itself. Or maybe the Commies didn't care  whether the crew was exposed or not. Or maybe there isn't any egg."    "All that's possible," I admitted. "But I want to see it, anyhow."    "Have you taken blood tests?" Joan asked Anderton.    "Yes."    "Get the reports through to me, then. I want white-cell counts,  differentials, platelet counts, hematocrit and sed rates on every man."    Anderton picked up the phone and I took a firm hold on the doorknob.    "Hey," Anderton said, putting the phone down again. "Are you going to  duck out just like that? Remember, Dr. Harris, we've got to evacuate the  city first of all! No matter whether it's a real egg or not--we can't  take the chance on it's _not_ being an egg!"    "Don't move a man until you get a go-ahead from CIA," I said. "For all  we know now, evacuating the city may be just what the enemy wants us to  do--so they can grab it unharmed. Or they may want to start a panic for  some other reason, any one of fifty possible reasons."    "You can't take such a gamble," he said grimly. "There are eight and a  half million lives riding on it. I can't let you do it."    "You passed your authority to us when you hired us," I pointed out. "If  you want to evacuate without our O.K., you'll have to fire us first.  It'll take another hour to get that cleared from Washington--so you  might as well give us the hour."    He stared at me for a moment, his lips thinned. Then he picked up the  phone again to order Joan's blood count, and I got out the door, fast.    *       *       *       *       *
