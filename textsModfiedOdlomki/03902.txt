  Bonnie moved in a bit closer. "Are you making another experiment?" she  asked.    "Who wants to know?" Bob answered, in his mad-scientist voice, as he  swaggered over to the refrigerator and took out an egg, some old bacon  fat, a capsuled vitamin pill, yesterday's Jello and a bottle of clam  juice.    "Me wants to know," said Bonnie, picking up an apple that had rolled  out of the refrigerator and fallen on the floor.    "Why should I tell you?"    "I have a quarter."    "Where'd you get it?"    "Mom gave it to me."    "If you give it to me, I'll tell you what I'm doing."    "It's not worth it."    "I'll let you be my assistant, too."    "Still not worth it."    "For ten cents?"    "Okay, ten cents."    *       *       *       *       *    She counted out the money to her brother and put on an apron. "What  should I do now, Bob?"    "Get the salt," Bob instructed.    He poured sardine oil from the can into the juicer, being very careful  not to let the sardines fall in. When he had squeezed the last drop of  oil out of the can, he ate all the sardines and tossed the can into the  sink.    Bonnie went after the salt and, when she lifted out the box, she found  a package containing two chocolate graham crackers.    "Mom has a new hiding place, Bob," she announced.    Bob looked up. "Where is it?"    "Behind the salt."    "What did you find there?"    "Two chocolate grahams."    Bobby held out his hand, accepted one of the crackers without thanks  and proceeded to crumble the whole thing into his concoction, not even  stopping to lick the chocolate off his hands.    Bonnie frowned in disbelief. She had never seen such self-sacrifice.
