  Ayesha held up her hand, in which there was no weapon, and waved it  forwards. A great cheer answered that signal to advance, and in the  midst of it this frail, white-robed woman spoke to her horse, so that it  plunged deep into the water.    Two minutes later, and spears and arrows were flying about us so thickly  that they seemed to darken the sky. I saw men and horses fall to right  and left, but nothing touched me or the white robes that floated a yard  or two ahead. Five minutes and we were gaining the further bank, and  there the worst fight began.    It was fierce indeed, yet never an inch did the white robes give back,  and where they went men would follow them or fall.
