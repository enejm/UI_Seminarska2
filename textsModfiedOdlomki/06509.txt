perhaps more--moving in a glen beyond the stream?    If you are hemmed in on all sides in a patch of land there is only one  chance of escape.  You must stay in the patch, and let your enemies  search it and not find you.  That was good sense, but how on earth was  I to escape notice in that table-cloth of a place?
