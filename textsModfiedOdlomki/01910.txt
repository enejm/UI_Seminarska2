Hartley Jones grinned in his engaging way. "You'd be good company," he  parried; "and, what's more, I think the trip would do you a lot of good.  You look all shot to pieces."    "Forget it," I laughed. "It's just the heat. And I'll have to leave you  here, Hart. Drop in and see us, will you? The wife was asking for you  only yesterday."    "Jack, dear," my wife greeted me at the door of my modest suburban home,  "Mr. Preston just called, and he wants you to call him right back."    "Oh, Lord," I groaned, "can't I forget the office for one evening?"  Preston was manager of the concern for which I worked.    Nevertheless, though our two fine youngsters were clamoring for their  dinner, I made the telephone call at once.    "Makely," came the voice of the boss, when the connection was completed,  "I want you to take the night plane for Frisco. Hate to ask you, but it  must be done. Townley is sick and someone has to take those Canadian Ex.  bonds out to Farnsworth. You're the only one to do it, and after you get  there, you can start on that vacation you need. Take a month if you  wish."    The thought of Hartley Jones' offer flashed through my mind. "But have  you read of the loss of the NY-18?" I asked Preston.    "I have, Makely. There'll be another hundred a month in your check, too,  to make up for the worry of your family. But the government is sending  thirty Secret Service men along on the SF-22, which leaves to-night. In  addition, there will be a convoy of seven fighting planes, so there is  not likely to be a repetition of the previous disasters."    That hundred a month sounded mighty good, for expenses had been mounting  rapidly of late. "All right, Mr. Preston," I agreed. "I will be at the  airport before midnight. But how about the bonds?"    "I'll drive around after dinner and deliver them to you. And thanks for  your willingness, Makely. You'll not be sorry."    *       *       *       *       *
