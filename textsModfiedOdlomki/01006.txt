  After luncheon Billy had a quiet half-hour with the Colonel in the  smoking-room.    Said Billy, between puffs of a cigar:    "Peggy's changed a bit."    The Colonel grunted. Perhaps he dared not trust to words.    "Seems to have made some new friends."    A more vigorous grunt.    "Cultured lot, they seem?" said Mr. Woods.
