  "Good _dog_!" cried the man.    Men in the shops' doorways echoed his shout.    "A _kid_," said the man. "They have to learn sometime, I know, but--"  He cut himself short. "Well, all's well that ends well." He glanced  respectfully at Dan. "If you're here any length of time, sir, we'd  certainly appreciate your looking into this.
