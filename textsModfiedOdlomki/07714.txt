 “Think of my mother!” shouted Mordaunt, as his horse plunged and darted  off at full gallop.    “Wretch!” exclaimed Aramis, raising his pistol as he passed by him; but  the powder flashed in the pan and it did not go off.    At this moment the whole regiment came up and they fell upon the few men  who had held out, surrounding the two Frenchmen. Athos, after making  sure that Lord Winter was really dead, let fall the corpse and said:    “Come, Aramis, now for the honor of France!” and the two Englishmen who  were nearest to them fell, mortally wounded.    At the same moment a fearful “hurrah!” rent the air and thirty blades  glittered about their heads.    Suddenly a man sprang out of the English ranks, fell upon Athos, twined  arms of steel around him, and tearing his sword from him, said in his  ear:    “Silence! yield--you yield to me, do you not?”    A giant had seized also Aramis’s two wrists, who struggled in vain to  release himself from this formidable grasp.    “D’Art----” exclaimed Athos, whilst the Gascon covered his mouth with  his hand.    “I am your prisoner,” said Aramis, giving up his sword to Porthos.    “Fire, fire!” cried Mordaunt, returning to the group surrounding the two  friends.    “And wherefore fire?” said the colonel; “every one has yielded.”    “It is the son of Milady,” said Athos to D’Artagnan.    “I recognize him.”    “It is the monk,” whispered Porthos to Aramis.    “I know it.”    And now the ranks began to open. D’Artagnan held the bridle of Athos’s  horse and Porthos that of Aramis. Both of them attempted to lead his  prisoner off the battle-field.    This movement revealed the spot where Winter’s body had fallen. Mordaunt  had found it out and was gazing on his dead relative with an expression  of malignant hatred.    Athos, though now cool and collected, put his hand to his belt, where  his loaded pistols yet remained.    “What are you about?” said D’Artagnan.
