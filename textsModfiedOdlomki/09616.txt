 those of us who are left?”    “They will serve Queen Flavia,” said I, “and I would to God I could be  one of them.”    A pause followed. Old Sapt broke it by saying sadly, yet with an unmeant  drollery that set Fritz and me laughing:    “Why didn’t old Rudolf the Third marry your--great-grandmother, was it?”    “Come,” said I, “it is the King we are thinking about.”    “It is true,” said Fritz.    “Moreover,” I went on, “I have been an impostor for the profit of  another, but I will not be one for my own; and if the King is not alive  and on his throne before the day of betrothal comes, I will tell the  truth, come what may.”    “You shall go, lad,” said Sapt.

De Gautet might or might  not come with him: that must be left to chance.    And when Rupert set his foot on the drawbridge? There was my part: for I  was minded for another swim in the moat; and, lest I should grow weary,
