 the President."    "The Young Labor party? I thought that gang was bankrupt and out of  business, since the Coast Guard broke up their alien smuggling scheme."    "They were down and out for a while, but they are in funds again--and  how! They must have three or four millions at least."    "Where did they get it?"    "That's what we have been trying to find out. The leaders have presented  bars of gold to a dozen banks throughout the country and demanded  specie. The banks shipped the gold to the mint and it was good gold,  nine hundred and twenty-five fine. What we are trying to find out is how  that gold got into the United States."    "A shipment of that size should be easy to trace."    "It would seem so, but it hasn't been. We have accounted for every pound  of every shipment that has come in through a port of entry, and we have  checked almost that close on the output of every mine in the United  States. If the gold came from Russia, it would have had to cross Europe,  and we can't get any trace of it from abroad. It looks as though they  were _making_ it."    *       *       *       *       *    Dr. Bird rubbed his head thoughtfully.    "Possible, but hardly probable," he said. "How much did you say they  had?"    "Over three millions in thirty-pound bars. Each bar shows signs of  having a mint mark chiselled off, but that don't help much for they have  done too good a job. It has us pretty well bluffed."    Again Dr. Bird rubbed his head.    "Telephone Admiral Buck, and then phone Bolton and tell him exactly what  I told you to: that you will be away indefinitely. When he gets through  exploding, tell him that you are going with me and that possibly, just  barely possibly, we might be on the trail of that gold shipment."
