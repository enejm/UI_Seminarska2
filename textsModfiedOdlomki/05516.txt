 of the asteroid; and the high magnification of this scope, with its  resulting small field of view, will require us continually and  methodically to search through a wide circle behind, in the attempt to  pick up the asteroid, should it appear. A tedious job, with chances of  sighting it about even.... At any rate, we'll have some sort of a  head-start," he finished.    *       *       *       *       *    This was the opportunity Leithgow had waited for; he wanted a few  frank words with his friend.    "Carse," he said slowly, "I wonder just where that man concealed  behind the secret panel would take the asteroid?"    "I've thought about that too," replied the Hawk. "We may be sure that  he went for allies: Dr. Ku has several on Satellite III. Of them all,  I think he would go for Lar Tantril."    "Tantril?"    "Yes, I think so. Lar Tantril, the Venusian. A fellow of much  self-confidence and one of Ku Sui's chief agents, and who at  present"--he smiled faintly--"nurses a special bitterness against me.  I told you how I tricked him on his ranch. He'd be very eager to  pursue us in the asteroid simply for the opportunity of repaying me  for that trick." The adventurer's left hand rose to the bangs of  flaxen hair combing down over his forehead, and he murmured, musingly:  "I rather hope it _is_ Lar Tantril...."    "You hope so?" Leithgow repeated, surprised. "When he hates you so?  And would be on the lookout for tricks? Why?"    "I would guess, Eliot, that Lar Tantril is not notable for intellect.  Blustering, domineering--pretty much of a braggart, you know.  Certainly he is not a model of caution; and he is not acquainted with  Dr. Ku's asteroid, for he did not even know it existed. He will be  able to run it, of course, with the advice of this hidden man, but  surely he will not have the perception to discern the weakness in it.
