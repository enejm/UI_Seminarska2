my friend, and getting him by the ear, I banged his head against the  doorway of his own hut, which was all that was left of it.    “‘You wicked old scoundrel,’ I said, ‘you dare to complain about your  own trifling inconveniences, when you gave me a rotten beam to sit on,  and thereby delivered me to the fury of the elephant’ (_bump! bump!  bump!_), ‘when your own wife’ (_bump!_) ‘has just been dragged out  of her hut’ (_bump!_) ‘like a snail from its shell, and thrown by the  Earth-shaker into a tree’ (_bump! bump!_).    “‘Mercy, my father, mercy!’ gasped the old fellow. ‘Truly I have done  amiss--my heart tells me so.’    “‘I should hope it did, you old villain’ (_bump!_).    “‘Mercy, great white man!

The elephant put her  there.’    “‘Alas! alas!’ he said, ‘surely the back of the ox is shaped to the  burden. Doubtless, my father, she will come down when she is tired;’ and  without troubling himself further about the matter, he began to blow at  the smouldering embers of the fire.    “And, as a matter of fact, she did appear a few minutes later,  considerably scratched and startled, but none the worse.    “After that I made my way to my little camp, which, fortunately, the  elephants had not walked over, and wrapping myself up in a blanket, was  soon fast asleep.    “And so ended my first round with those three elephants.”
