  4.  How The Nome King Planned Revenge    The reason most people are bad is because they do not try to be good.  Now, the Nome King had never tried to be good, so he was very bad  indeed.  Having decided to conquer the Land of Oz and to destroy the  Emerald City and enslave all its people, King Roquat the Red kept  planning ways to do this dreadful thing, and the more he planned the  more he believed he would be able to accomplish it.    About the time Dorothy went to Ozma the Nome King called his Chief  Steward to him and said:    "Kaliko, I think I shall make you the General of my armies."    "I think you won't," replied Kaliko, positively.    "Why not?" inquired the King, reaching for his scepter with the big  sapphire.    "Because I'm your Chief Steward and know nothing of warfare," said  Kaliko, preparing to dodge if anything were thrown at him.  "I manage  all the affairs of your kingdom better than you could yourself, and  you'll never find another Steward as good as I am.  But there are a  hundred Nomes better fitted to command your army, and your Generals get  thrown away so often that I have no desire to be one of them."    "Ah, there is some truth in your remarks, Kaliko," remarked the King,  deciding not to throw the scepter.  "Summon my army to assemble in the  Great Cavern."    Kaliko bowed and retired, and in a few minutes returned to say that the  army was assembled.  So the King went out upon a balcony that  overlooked the Great Cavern, where fifty thousand Nomes, all armed with  swords and pikes, stood marshaled in military array.    When they were not required as soldiers all these Nomes were metal  workers and miners, and they had hammered so much at the forges and dug  so hard with pick and shovel that they had acquired great muscular  strength.  They were strangely formed creatures, rather round and not  very tall.  Their toes were curly and their ears broad and flat.
