  “Gad, you’re thirsty tonight,” chuckled Sapt. “So be it.”    We mounted, drawing our swords, and waited silently for a minute or two.  Then we heard the tramp of men on the drive the other side of the house.  They came to a stand, and one cried:    “Now then, fetch him out!”    “Now!” whispered Sapt.    Driving the spurs into our horses, we rushed at a gallop round the  house, and in a moment we were among the ruffians. Sapt told me  afterwards that he killed a man, and I believe him; but I saw no more of  him. With a cut, I split the head of a fellow on a brown horse, and he  fell to the ground.

Oh, we’ll give Black Michael some work before we’ve done!”    Pausing an instant, we made a bandage for my wounded finger, which was  bleeding freely and ached severely, the bone being much bruised.
