 fear we had missed it.  It was no good asking any of the crowd we met.  They didn't look as if they understood any civilized tongue.    At last we stumbled on it--a tumble-down coffee house, with A.  Kuprasso above the door in queer amateur lettering.  There was a lamp  burning inside, and two or three men smoking at small wooden tables.    We ordered coffee, thick black stuff like treacle, which Peter  anathematized.  A negro brought it, and I told him in German I wanted  to speak to Mr Kuprasso.  He paid no attention, so I shouted louder at  him, and the noise brought a man out of the back parts.    He was a fat, oldish fellow with a long nose, very like the Greek  traders you see on the Zanzibar coast.  I beckoned to him and he  waddled forward, smiling oilily.  Then I asked him what he would take,  and he replied, in very halting German, that he would have a sirop.    'You are Mr Kuprasso,' I said.  'I wanted to show this place to my  friend.  He has heard of your garden-house and the fun there.'    'The Signor is mistaken.  I have no garden-house.'    'Rot,' I said; 'I've been here before, my boy.  I recall your shanty at  the back and many merry nights there.  What was it you called it? Oh, I  remember--the Garden-House of Suliman the Red.'    He put his finger to his lip and looked incredibly sly.  'The Signor  remembers that.  But that was in the old happy days before war came.  The place is long since shut.  The people here are too poor to dance  and sing.'    'All the same I would like to have another look at it,' I said, and I  slipped an English sovereign into his hand.    He glanced at it in surprise and his manner changed.  'The Signor is a  Prince, and I will do his will.'  He clapped his hands and the negro  appeared, and at his nod took his place behind a little side-counter.
