  "You remember how poor Cain seemed to take great interest in the Atom  Smasher. There's no way of telling what had been going on in that  brain of his, but it looks to me like he'd known that that lever meant  death. It was sealed up in wax, and Tode had got it free on the way  out of Atlantis.    "Well--this it what I made out from examining the thing afterward.  Cain had been monkeying with the lever. He'd pried loose one of the  wires that hooked to the transformer, and short-circuited it, not  knowing, of course, just what he was doing. The result was that when  Tode pressed that lever, instead of blowing the whole contraption to  pieces, he got a couple of billion volts of electricity through his  body, combined with a larger amperage than has ever been imagined. It  burned him to a few grease spots. He simply--vanished. You don't  remember what you did at the moment, boy?"    "I don't seem to remember anything," said Jim.    "Well, your response was an automatic one. You jumped him. Luckily  you were too late, for Tode vanished like that!" Old Parrish snapped  his fingers. "But you must have got into the field of magnetic  force--any way, you were almost electrocuted. Lucille and I thought  you were dead for hours.    "We laid you down and set a course for home. I used those dial  numberings Tode had given me. He'd said they wouldn't work, but he'd  lied. They did work. They brought us back to the Vanishing Place.    "We carried you out, and then I saw your eyelid twitch. We worked over  you with artificial respiration till it looked as if there was a  chance for you. Then I shut off the power and let the waters rush in  over the Atom Smasher, and swam ashore. And there it lies at the  bottom of the pool, and may it lie there till the Judgment Day."    *       *       *       *       *
