  The storeroom was a damp chamber in what had been the old farmhouse.  There was no carpet on the uneven floor, and nothing to sit down on but  a school form.  It was black as pitch, for the windows were heavily  shuttered.  I made out by groping that the walls were lined with boxes  and barrels and sacks of some heavy stuff.  The whole place smelt of  mould and disuse.  My gaolers turned the key in the door, and I could  hear them shifting their feet as they stood on guard outside.
