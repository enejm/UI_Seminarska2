  "No. During the week."    He shook his head. "In that case, no. Discounting the fact that you  could have prearranged it, if my dim provisional theory is right, that  would be _actually_ impossible. It would involve time-reversal. I'll  tell you about it later. No, just throw down the change. Let's see if  they all come up heads."    I moved away from the carpet and tossed the handful of coins onto the  floor. They clattered and bounced--and bounced together--and stacked  themselves into a neat pile.    I looked at McGill. His eyes were narrowed. Without a word, he took a  handful of coins from his own pocket and threw them.    These coins didn't stack. They just fell into an exactly straight line,  the adjacent ones touching.    "Well," I said, "what more do you want?"    "Great Scott," he said, and sat down. "I suppose you know that  there are two great apparently opposite principles governing the  Universe--random and design. The sands on the beach are an example  of random distribution and life is an example of design. The motions  of the particles of a gas are what we call random, but there are so  many of them, we treat them statistically and derive the Second Law of  Thermodynamics--quite reliable. It isn't theoretically hard-and-fast;  it's just a matter of extreme probability. Now life, on the other  hand, seems not to depend on probability at all; actually, it goes  against it. Or you might say it is certainly not an accidental  manifestation."    "Do you mean," I asked in some confusion, "that some form of life is  controlling the coins and--the other things?"    *       *       *       *       *    He shook his head. "No. All I mean is that improbable things usually  have improbable explanations. When I see a natural law being broken,  I don't say to myself, 'Here's a miracle.' I revise my version of the  book of rules. Something--I don't know what--is going on, and it seems
