 outsprawled thing that had once been a man. Stooping, he very gently  turned the mess of charred flesh over and peered at what was left of  the face. There were small, burnt holes in it, and the flesh  surrounding them looked as though it had been suspended for some time  over a slow fire....    Carse rose and stared into space.    "Ruthers, a guard," he said softly, as if speaking to himself. He  walked on.    Another heap of flesh was pitched before the front wall of the  ranch-house. The man it had been a little while before had evidently  been running for the door when the deadly rays had got him. His  ray-gun was lying a few feet away. Again Carse stooped and again very  gently pulled the ragged thing over.    "By God!" stammered Harkness suddenly, staring, his face white,  "that--that's Jack O'Fallon--old Jack O'Fallon! Why, we went to  navigation school together! We--"    "Yes," said the Hawk, "O'Fallon, overseer." He stepped into the house.  Friday, impassive and grim, pulled Harkness away from the distorted  body.    *       *       *       *       *    Three more were tumbled together behind a splintered table in the main  room. The rays had done their work well. Three were welded, it seemed,  into one.... It was some time before the Hawk's frigid whisper came.    "Martin ... Olafson ... and this--Antil ... Antil was the only  Venusian I ever liked...."    The chairs and tables in the room were overturned, most of them bore  the seared scars of ray-guns, which showed plainly enough that there  had been a desperate last minute hand-to-hand struggle there, after  the defensive ray-web had failed and the pirates rushed the building.  The radio alcove was choked with seared, cracked wreckage. Crane, the  operator, still sat in his seat, but he was slumped over forward, and  his head and chest were pitted with slanting ray holes. One hand had  been reaching for a dial. The other was twisted and charred.
