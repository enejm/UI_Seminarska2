sliced thumb. One plastic handle of the pot was still smoldering, from  being too near the fire, but none of these things seemed to have the  slightest effect on him. He put the pot down in the middle of the table  and stared at it, chin in hand.    Bonnie plopped down opposite him, put her chin in her hands and asked,  "We _have_ to drink that stuff?"    "Yup."    "Who has to drink it first?" Bob made no sign of having heard. "I  thought so," said Bonnie. Still no comment. "What if it kills me?"
