 figured a living Eighth Wonder would be more valuable than a dead one;  and I didn't think he could be stuffed. But somehow I forgot it in my  interest in examining this unusual personage.    The little man had dropped the cloth now, and was staring in my  direction. Of course, "my direction" was very general to him; but he  seemed to be conscious of me. He certainly impressed _me_ as being  awfully different, but what his reactions were, I didn't know.    But someone else knew.    *       *       *       *       *    In a world deep down in Smallness, in an electron of a dead cell of a  piece of wood, five scientists were grouped before a complicated  instrument with a horn like the early radios. Two sat and three stood,  but their attention upon the apparatus was unanimous. From small  hollowed cups worn on their fingers like rings, came a smoke from  burning incense. These cups they held to their noses frequently, and  their eyes shone as they inhaled. The scientists of infra-smallness were  smoking!

There had been breaks before, but this silence had been long-enduring.    Now the voice was speaking again; a voice that was a telepathic  communication made audible. The scientists brightened.    "There is much that I cannot understand," it said. The words were  hesitant, filled with awe. "I seem to have been in many worlds. At the  completion of my experiment, I stood on a land which was brown and black  and very rough of surface. With startling suddenness, I was propelled  across this harsh country, and, terrifyingly, I was falling. I must have  dropped seventy-five feet, but the strange buoyant atmosphere of this  strange world saved me from harm.
