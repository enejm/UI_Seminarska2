pattering of scurrying hoofs and the herd was gone; but Numa, the lion,  moved not.  He was familiar with the ways of Pacco, the zebra.  He knew  that he would return, though many times he might wheel and fly before  he summoned the courage to lead his harem and his offspring to the  water.  There was the chance that Pacco might be frightened off  entirely.  Numa had seen this happen before, and so he became almost  rigid lest he be the one to send them galloping, waterless, back to the  plain.    Again and again came Pacco and his family, and again and again did they  turn and flee; but each time they came closer to the river, until at  last the plump stallion dipped his velvet muzzle daintily into the  water.  The others, stepping warily, approached their leader.
