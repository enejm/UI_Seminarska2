next step be? Invasion?"    "But they only have one ship, sir."    "You know that only because they say so. They might have a fleet."    "I've told you about their size. They--"    "Their size would not matter, if they have handweapons that may well be  superior to our artillery."    "That is not what I meant."    "I had this partly in mind from the first." The Industrialist went on.  "It is for that reason I agreed to see them after I received your  letter. Not to agree to an unsettling and impossible trade, but to judge  their real purposes. I did not count on their evading the meeting."    He sighed. "I suppose it isn't our fault. You are right in one thing, at  any rate. The world has been at peace too long. We are losing a healthy  sense of suspicion."    The Astronomer's mild voice rose to an unusual pitch and he said, "I  _will_ speak. I tell you that there is no reason to suppose they can  possibly be hostile. They are small, yes, but that is only important  because it is a reflection of the fact that their native worlds are  small. Our world has what is for them a normal gravity, but because of  our much higher gravitational potential, our atmosphere is too dense to  support them comfortably over sustained periods. For a similar reason  the use of the world as a base for interstellar travel, except for trade  in certain items, is uneconomical. And there are important differences  in chemistry of life due to the basic differences in soils. They  couldn't eat our food or we theirs."    "Surely all this can be overcome. They can bring their own food, build  domed stations of lowered air pressure, devise specially designed  ships."    "They can. And how glibly you can describe feats that are easy to a race  in its youth. It is simply that they don't have to do any of that. There  are millions of worlds suitable for them in the Galaxy. They don't need  this one which isn't."    "How do you know? All this is their information again."
