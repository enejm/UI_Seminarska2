"A month," said Grantline. "A month at the most. If we can hold them  off that long--even in a week or two help may come."    Another day. A tenseness fell on us all, despite the absorption of our  feverish activities. To conserve the power, the camp was almost dark,  we lived in dim, chill rooms, with just a few weak spots of light  outside to mark the watchmen on their rounds. We did not use the  telescope,[3] but there was scarcely an hour when one or the other of  the men was not sitting on a cross-piece up in the dome of the little  instrument room, casting tense searching gaze into the black, starry  firmament.
