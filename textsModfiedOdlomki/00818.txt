 With this gracious speech Glinda dismissed the adventurers, and they  wandered away through the beautiful gardens, where they passed several hours  enjoying all the delightful things with which the Queen of the Southland had  surrounded her royal palace.    On the following morning they again appeared before Glinda, who said to  them:    "I have searched carefully through the records of the Wizard's actions, and  among them I can find but three that appear to have been suspicious. He ate  beans with a knife, made three secret visits to old Mombi, and limped  slightly on his left foot."    "Ah! that last is certainly suspicious!" exclaimed the Pumpkinhead.    "Not necessarily," said the Scarecrow. "he may, have had corns. Now, it  seems to me his eating beans with a knife is more suspicious."    "Perhaps it is a polite custom in Omaha, from which great country the Wizard  originally came," suggested the Tin Woodman.    "It may be," admitted the Scarecrow.        244    "But why," asked Glinda, "did he make three secret visits to old Mombi?"    "Ah! Why, indeed!" echoed the Woggle-Bug, impressively.    "We know that the Wizard taught the old woman many of his tricks of magic,"  continued Glinda; "and this he would not have done had she not assisted him  in some way. So we may suspect with good reason that Mombi aided him to hide  the girl Ozma, who was the real heir to the throne of the Emerald City, and  a constant danger to the usurper. For, if the people knew that she lived,  they would quickly make her their Queen and restore her to her rightful  position."    "An able argument!" cried the Scarecrow. "I have no doubt that Mombi was  mixed up in this wicked business. But how does that knowledge help us?"    "We must find Mombi," replied Glinda, "and force her to tell where the girl  is hidden."    "Mombi is now with Queen Jinjur, in the Emerald, City" said Tip. "It was she  who threw so many obstacles in our pathway, and made Jinjur threaten to  destroy my friends and give me back into the old witch's power."
