  Here their guides paused and waited for the main party.    There followed another conference, whereupon their leader stepped up  again, indicating this time that they were to remove their suits.    At this, Professor Stevens balked.    "It is suicide!" he declared. "The air to which they are accustomed  here is doubtless at many times our own atmospheric pressure."    "But I don't see that there's anything to do about it," said Larry, as  their captors danced about them menacingly. "I for one will take a  chance!"    And before they could stop him, he had pressed the release-valve,  emitting the air from his suit--slowly, at first, then more and more  rapidly, as no ill effects seemed to result.    Finally, flinging off the now deflated suit, he stepped before them in  his ordinary clothes, calling with a smile:    "Come on out, folks--the air's fine!"    *       *       *       *       *    This statement was somewhat of an exaggeration, as the air smelt dank  and bad. But at least it was breathable, as Diane and her father found  when they emerged from their own suits.

Once again the leader of the curious throng stepped up to them,  beaming now and addressing Professor Stevens in some barbaric tongue,  and, to their amazement, he replied in words approximating its harsh  syllables.    "Why, daddy!" gasped Diane. "How can you talk to him?"    "Simply enough," was the reply. "They speak a language which seems to  be about one-third Basque, mixed oddly with Greek. It merely proves  another hypothesis of mine, namely, that the Atlantean influence  reached eastward to the Pyrenees mountains and the Hellenic peninsula,  as well as to Egypt."    *       *       *       *       *
