   "I do believe," Robert said as he placed a heavy arm around Muldoon's  shoulder, and walked him to the door, "that we shall have a mutually  happy relationship. You will not be unrewarded, moneywise." He opened  the door, paused, still with his arm around Muldoon, and looked steadily  into Muldoon's eyes. "Yes, I think there will be mutual benefits in our  relationship. Now, in conclusion, will you pick us up at this office  tomorrow morning at nine?"    Muldoon nodded.    "Good! Then 'bye now, Mr. Muldoon, and thanks so much for coming by in  answer to our ad."    The answer to an irritating thought came to Muldoon while he was waiting  for an elevator to take him to the ground floor. He knew where he had  seen the same kind of look as was in Robert Reeger's eyes when they had  parted. In the eyes of a cat Muldoon had once seen toying with a mouse  the cat had caught....

Deena had no imagination when it came to food.  Even in restaurants she ordered one or another kind of steak.    They were together on the couch, she stretched full-length, her head in  Muldoon's lap. He was telling her about the Reeger twins and what had  happened that morning. His hands caressed her lightly as she spoke, now  across her cheeks, now more intimately.    "... I don't dig them, Honey," he said, as if in recapitulation. "The  Robert twin, f'r instance. 'You will not be unrewarded, moneywise.'  Madison Avenue and Nineteenth Century English...."
