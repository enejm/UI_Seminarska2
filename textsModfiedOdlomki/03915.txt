"I don't like to be a chicken, Bob," it said.    "Why not? What does it feel like?"    "It feels skinny and I can't see so good."    "How else does it feel?"    "That's all how it feels. Make me stop being it."    "First tell me better what it's like."    "I told you already. Make me stop being it."    "What are you afraid of? Why don't you see what it's like first, before  you change back? This is a valuable experience."    The chicken tried to put its hands on its hips, but could find neither  hips nor hands. "You better change me back, boy," it said, and gave Bob  the left-eye glare.    "Will you stop being stupid and just see what it's like first?" Bob was  finding it difficult to understand her lack of curiosity.    "Wait till Mom sees what an ugly mess I am, boy. Will you ever get it!"  Bonnie was trying very hard to see Bob with both eyes at once, which  was impossible.    "You're a sissy, Bonnie. You ruined the opportunity of a lifetime. I'm  disgusted with you." Bob dipped his forefinger in the serum and held it  toward the chicken. It pecked what it could from the finger and tilted  its head back.    In an instant, the chicken was gone and Bonnie was back. She climbed  down from the table, wiped her eyes and said, "It's a good thing you  fixed me, boy. Would you ever have got it."    "Ah, you're nothing but a sissy," Bob said, and licked off a whole  fingerful of his formula. "If I change into a horse, I won't let you  ride me, and if I change into a leopard, I'll bite your head off." Once  again, the loud _pop_ was heard.    *       *       *       *       *    Bonnie stood up, wide-eyed. "Oh, Bob," she said, "you're beautiful!"    "What am I?" Bob asked.
