  He took one step toward the bed.    The little girl eyes over their dusting of freckles slitted. Then they  opened wide, became two glowing golden lakes that grew, and grew--    There was the feeling of a great soundless explosion in his mind. Waves  of cool burning in his brain, churning and bubbling in every unknown  corner, every cranny. Here and there a cell, or a group of cells,  blanked out, the complex molecules reverting, becoming new again. Ready  for fresh punch marks. Synapses shorted with soundless cold fire, and  waited in timeless stasis for rechannelling. The waves frothed, became  ripples, were gone. He stood unmoving.    What was it he was supposed to do? Let's see-- Tuck Joanna's blanket  around her. But she was covered up snugly. Sleeping soundly, too, and  for a few seconds he'd thought she was awake. And Jean was waiting  downstairs, Jean and a cool drink.    Oh, yes, stop in the bathroom.    The stairs wind up again. It is good to be with one's family, relaxed in  the well known chair. Not a worry in the world.    He sat there, his mind at ease, not caring much about anything. He  didn't even look up when the clock on the mantel whirred, and the  ridiculous bird popped out of its nest to herald a new day.
