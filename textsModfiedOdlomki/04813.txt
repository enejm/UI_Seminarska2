Helen--what creatures were these? Helen--not dead, not poor,--carefully  planting ostensible proof of her death and going on to a new role, a new  life, in London or Paris or Rome. A free, untrammelled life. And her  child--if child was the word--in his home, repeating the pattern.  Eliminating competition as her mother undoubtedly had done.
