  "Shopping."    Bonnie inched a little closer. "What are you doing, Bob?" she asked.    "Nothing."    "Can I watch?"    "No."    Bonnie took this as a cue to advance two cautious steps. She knew from  experience how close she could approach her brother when he was being  creative and still maintain a peaceful neutrality. Bob slopped a cupful  of ketchup into the juicer, added a can of powdered mustard, a drop of  milk, six aspirin and a piece of chewing gum, being careful to spill a  part of each package used.    Bonnie moved in a bit closer. "Are you making another experiment?" she  asked.    "Who wants to know?" Bob answered, in his mad-scientist voice, as he  swaggered over to the refrigerator and took out an egg, some old bacon  fat, a capsuled vitamin pill, yesterday's Jello and a bottle of clam  juice.    "Me wants to know," said Bonnie, picking up an apple that had rolled  out of the refrigerator and fallen on the floor.    "Why should I tell you?"    "I have a quarter."    "Where'd you get it?"    "Mom gave it to me."    "If you give it to me, I'll tell you what I'm doing."    "It's not worth it."    "I'll let you be my assistant, too."    "Still not worth it."    "For ten cents?"    "Okay, ten cents."    *       *       *       *       *    She counted out the money to her brother and put on an apron. "What  should I do now, Bob?"    "Get the salt," Bob instructed.    He poured sardine oil from the can into the juicer, being very careful  not to let the sardines fall in. When he had squeezed the last drop of  oil out of the can, he ate all the sardines and tossed the can into the  sink.
