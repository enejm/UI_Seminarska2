  But the next day he went to Grizek and demanded his pay in full.    "Leaving?" Grizek muttered. "I don't understand. You've been with us  almost five years. Where you going, what you intend to do? What's got  into you all of a sudden?"    "Time for a change," Harry told him. "I've been saving my money."    "Don't I know it? Never touched a penny in all this time." Grizek ran  a hand across his chin. "Say, if it's a raise you're looking for, I  can--"    "No, thanks. It's not that. I've money enough."    "So you have.

It wasn't easy to accustom himself to urbanization again. He had been  away from cities for over seven years now, and it might well have been  seven centuries. The overpopulation problem was appalling. The  outlawing of private automotive vehicles had helped, and the clearing  of the airlanes served a purpose; the widespread increase in the use  of atomic power cut the smog somewhat. But the synthetic food was  frightful, the crowding intolerable, and the welter of rules and  regulations attending the performance of even the simplest human
