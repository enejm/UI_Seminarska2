 "Run! Run! They're coming! They're coming out!"    They turned, panic-stricken; the torches fell flaring to the ground,  to lie there in pools of flame; the brigands ran for the nearest  shelter, the dark bulk of the ranch house close by. They ran, fear  tingling their spines, in their ears the sound of the maddened  phantis.    *       *       *       *       *    From his vantage point on the roof of the ranch house, the Hawk  confirmed his quick decision that this was the only way.
