though struck by a thunderbolt, while a horrible smell of musk and  burned flesh filled the air.    "After it! Quick!" cried the doctor as he sprang forward.    *       *       *       *       *    Before he could reach the prostrate creature it moved and then, slowly  at first, but with rapidly gaining speed, it slithered over the floor in  retreat. Dr. Bird's hand swung through an arc, and there was a deafening  crash as a hand-grenade exploded on the back of the fleeing monster.    An unearthly scream came from the creature, and its motion changed from  a steady forward glide to a series of convulsive jerks. Leffingwell and  Carnes threw grenades, but they went wide of their mark, and the monster  began to again increase its speed. Another volley of grenades was thrown  and one hit scored, which slowed the monster somewhat but did not arrest  the steady forward movement.    "Any more bombs?" demanded the doctor.    "Damn!" he cried as he received negative answers. "The current wasn't  strong enough. It's going to get away."    Carnes jerked his automatic from under his armpit and poured a stream of  bullets into the fleeing monster. Slower and slower the motion of the  creature became, and its movements again became jerky and convulsive.    "Keep it in sight!" cried the doctor. "We may get it yet!"    Cautiously the three men followed the retreating horror, Leffingwell  pushing before him the platform holding the ultra-violet ray apparatus.  The chase led them over familiar ground.    "There is the crack!" cried the lieutenant.    "Too late!" replied the doctor.    He rushed forward and seized the lower limb of the monster and tried  with all his strength to arrest its flight, but despite all that he  could do it slid sideways through the crack in the wall and disappeared.  A final backward kick of its leg threw the doctor twenty feet against  the far wall of the cave.
