   The one at the instrument panel received a curt order: the weird voice  of the man in red repeated a word that stood out above his curious,  wordless tone. "Torg," he said, and again McGuire heard him repeat the  syllable.    The operator touched here and there among his instruments, and tiny  lights flashed; he threw a switch, and from one of the black openings  like a deep cave came a rushing roar of sound.
