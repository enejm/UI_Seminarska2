  Presently my heart stood still, for I thought I heard a faint answer. I  drew nearer to the place from which the sound seemed to come, and again  called. Yes, there was an answer in my wife’s voice. It seemed to come  from the rock. I went up to it and searched among the creepers, but  still could find no opening.    “Move the stone,” cried Stella’s voice, “the cave is shut with a stone.”    I took a spear and prodded at the cliff whence the sound came. Suddenly  the spear sunk in through a mass of lichen. I swept the lichen aside,  revealing a boulder that had been rolled into the mouth of an opening in  the rock, which it fitted so accurately that, covered as it was by  the overhanging lichen, it might well have escaped the keenest eye. We  dragged the boulder out; it was two men’s work to do it. Beyond was  a narrow, water-worn passage, which I followed with a beating heart.  Presently the passage opened into a small cave, shaped like a pickle  bottle, and coming to a neck at the top end. We passed through and found  ourselves in a second, much larger cave, that I at once recognized as  the one of which Indaba-zimbi had shown me a vision in the water. Light  reached it from above--how I know not--and by it I could see a form  half-sitting, half lying on some skins at the top end of the cave. I  rushed to it. It was Stella! Stella bound with strips of hide, bruised,  torn, but still Stella, and alive.    She saw me, she gave one cry, then, as I caught her in my arms, she  fainted. It was happy indeed that she did not faint before, for had it  not been for the sound of her voice I do not believe we should ever have  found that cunningly hidden cave, unless, indeed, Indaba-zimbi’s magic  (on which be blessings) had come to our assistance.    We bore her to the open air, laid her beneath the shade of a tree, and  cut the bonds loose from her ankles. As we went I glanced at the cave.
