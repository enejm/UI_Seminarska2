"None at all?" inquired the man.    "None at all," answered the boy.    "Then I'll not break my back rowing you over," said the ferryman, decidedly.    "What a nice man!" remarked the Pumpkinhead, smilingly.    The ferryman stared at him, but made no reply. Tip was trying to think, for  it was a great disappointment to him to find his journey so suddenly brought  to an end.    "I must certainly get to the Emerald City," he said to the boatman; "but how  can I cross the river if you do not take me?"    The man laughed, and it was not a nice laugh.    "That wooden horse will float," said he; "and        61               Line-Art Drawing    you can ride him across. As for the pumpkinheaded loon who accompanies you,  let him sink or swim it won't matter greatly which."    "Don't worry about me," said Jack, smiling pleasantly upon the crabbed  ferryman; "I'm sure I ought to float beautifully."    Tip thought the experiment was worth making, and the Saw-Horse, who did not  know what danger meant, offered no objections whatever. So the boy led it  down into the water and climbed upon its back. Jack also waded in up to his  knees and        62  grasped the tail of the horse so that he might keep his pumpkin head above  the water.    "Now," said Tip, instructing the Saw-Horse, "if you wiggle your legs you  will probably swim; and if you swim we shall probably reach the other side."    The Saw-Horse at once began to wiggle its legs, which acted as oars and  moved the adventurers slowly across the river to the opposite side. So  successful was the trip that presently they were climbing, wet and dripping,  up the grassy bank.    Tip's trouser-legs and shoes were thoroughly soaked; but the Saw-Horse had  floated so perfectly that from his knees up the boy was entirely dry. As for  the Pumpkinhead, every stitch of his gorgeous clothing dripped water.
