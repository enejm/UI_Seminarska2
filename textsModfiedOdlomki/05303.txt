missed one of the sleeping forms by inches. But the buru cared not for  them. It was not a flesh-eater. Its undulating neck stretched far out;  its head dipped; water was lapped up--until it caught sight of the  uprooted giant stump lying pitched in the pool. The beast drank but  little after that, and retreated as cautiously as it had come.    Five or six of its fellows of the swamps followed at intervals to the  water, grotesque hulking shapes, odorous and slimy with mud. All drank  from the same spot; all ignored, save for a tentative rooting snuffle,  the unconscious figures lying puny beneath them. But all noticed the  twisted roots of the stump, sticking out in a score of directions, and  avoided them.    And then there came smaller, more cautious animals who did not drink  from the favored spot, who surveyed it, sniffed, hesitated, and  finally retreated. There was a good reason for this caution.    For with the falling of night the stump had been at least thirty feet  out in the water; now it was not ten feet from the side of the spit,  and not twelve feet from the nearest sleeping figure. The suits that  clad the three figures were sealed, the face-plates closed, so there  was probably--after their trip through the void--no man smell to  attract the giants of swamp and trees. But those three figures had  moved. That was lure enough for one monster.    When the first ruddy arrows of Jupiter's light laced through the  jungle's highest foliage, the twisted, gnarled stump was settled on  the peninsula's rim, half out of the water. And when day burst, when  Jupiter's flaming arch pushed over into view, the long seeming-roots  eeled forward in sinuous reptilian life.    *       *       *       *       *    In one second Hawk Carse was snatched from sleep into the turmoil of a  fight for life.    Something hard and enormously powerful was wrapping his waist with a  vise-like grip that threatened to cut him in two. He felt a leg go up
