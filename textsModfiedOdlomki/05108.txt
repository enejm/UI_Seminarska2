   McGill went over and they discussed the problem in undertones. Finally  the man left and Molly called her mother to reassure her. McGill tried  to explain to me what had happened with the phone.    "You must have joggled something loose. And then you replaced the  receiver in such a way that the contact wasn't quite open."    "But for Pete's sake, Molly says the calls were going on for a long  time! I phoned you only a short time ago and it must have taken her  nearly two hours to get here from Oyster Bay."    "Then you must have done it twice and the vibrations in the  floor--something like that--just happened to cause the right induction  impulses. Yes, I know how you feel," he said, seeing my expression.  "It's beginning to bear down."    Molly was through telephoning and suggested going out for dinner. I was  so pleased to see her that I'd forgotten all about being hungry.    "I'm in no mood to cook," she said. "Let's get away from all this."    McGill raised an eyebrow. "If all this, as you call it, will let us."    In the lobby, we ran into Nat, looking smug in a journalistic way.    "I've been put on the story--who could be better?--I live here. So far,  I don't quite get what's been happening. I've been talking to Danny,  but he didn't say much. I got the feeling he thinks you're involved in  some mystical, Hibernian way. Hello, McGill, what's with you?"    "He's got a theory," said Molly. "Come and eat with us and he'll tell  you all about it."    Since we decided on an air-conditioned restaurant nearby on Sixth  Avenue, we walked. The jam of cars didn't seem to be any less than  before and we saw Danny again. He was talking to a police lieutenant,  and when he caught sight of us, he said something that made the  lieutenant look at us with interest. Particularly at me.    "If you want your umbrella, Mrs. Graham," Danny said, "it's at the  station house. What there's left of it, that is."
