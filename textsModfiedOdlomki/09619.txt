“Madame, the King is here--in the bushes! May I guide you to him,  madame?”    “Nonsense, child!” said old Strakencz; “the King lies wounded in the  Castle.”    “Yes, sir, he’s wounded, I know; but he’s there--with Count Fritz--and  not at the Castle,” she persisted.    “Is he in two places, or are there two Kings?” asked Flavia, bewildered.  “And how should he be there?”    “He pursued a gentleman, madame, and they fought till Count Fritz came;  and the other gentleman took my father’s horse from me and rode away;  but the King is here with Count Fritz.
