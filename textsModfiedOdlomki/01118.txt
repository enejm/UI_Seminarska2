 she had picked up by accident afterward. The second column was a  continuation of the first: there were forty-six items in each, each item  numbered consecutively--    "Probably used uranium because it's the largest of the natural atoms,"  Penrose was saying. "The fact that there's nothing beyond it there shows  that they hadn't created any of the transuranics. A student could go to  that thing and point out the outer electron of any of the ninety-two  elements."    *       *       *       *       *    Ninety-two! That was it; there were ninety-two items in the table on the  left wall! Hydrogen was Number One, she knew; One, _Sarfaldsorn_. Helium  was Two; that was _Tirfaldsorn_. She couldn't remember which element  came next, but in Martian it was _Sarfalddavas_. _Sorn_ must mean  matter, or substance, then. And _davas_; she was trying to think of what  it could be. She turned quickly to the others, catching hold of Hubert  Penrose's arm with one hand and waving her clipboard with the other.    "Look at this thing, over here," she was clamoring excitedly. "Tell me  what you think it is. Could it be a table of the elements?"    They all turned to look. Mort Tranter stared at it for a moment.    "Could be. If I only knew what those squiggles meant--"    That was right; he'd spent his time aboard the ship.    "If you could read the numbers, would that help?" she asked, beginning  to set down the Arabic digits and their Martian equivalents. "It's  decimal system, the same as we use."    "Sure. If that's a table of elements, all I'd need would be the numbers.  Thanks," he added as she tore off the sheet and gave it to him.    Penrose knew the numbers, and was ahead of him. "Ninety-two items,  numbered consecutively. The first number would be the atomic number.  Then a single word, the name of the element. Then the atomic weight--"    She began reading off the names of the elements. "I know hydrogen and
