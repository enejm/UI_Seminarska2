Turn, kick, out, step. I am swinging round away from him, let's hope  he finds it reassuring. I dare not look up but I think the light is  dimming. Turn, kick, out, step. Boxing the compass. Coming round  again.    And the cloud is coming over the moon, out of the corner of my eye I  see darkness sweeping towards us--and I see his face of sheer horror  as he sees it, too; he jumps back, swings up the weapon, and fires  straight in my face.    And it is dark. So much for Psychology.    There is a clatter and other sounds--    Well, quite a lot for Psychology maybe, because at twenty feet he  seems to have missed me.    *       *       *       *       *    I pick myself up and touch something which apparently is his weapon,  gun or whatever. I leave it and hare back to the stretcher, next-to  fall over it but stop just in time, and switch on the antigrav. Up;  level it; now where to? The cliffs enclosing the bay are about thirty  yards off to my left and they offer the only cover.    The shingle is relatively level; I make good time till I stumble  against a rock and nearly lose the stretcher. I step up on to the rock  and see the cliff as a blacker mass in the general darkness, only a  yard away. I edge the stretcher round it.    It is almost snatched out of my hand by a gust of wind. I pull it back  and realize that in the bay I have been sheltered; there is pretty  near half a gale blowing across the face of the cliff.    Voices and footsteps, away back among the rocks where the man came  from.    If the clouds part again they will see me, sure as shooting.    I take a hard grip on the stretcher and scramble round the edge of the  cliff.
