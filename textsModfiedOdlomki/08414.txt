 disposition to invest us, with the view of starving us out."    "That's awkward."    "Yes; especially as Infadoos says that the water supply has given out."    "My lord, that is so," said Infadoos; "the spring cannot supply the  wants of so great a multitude, and it is failing rapidly. Before night  we shall all be thirsty. Listen, Macumazahn. Thou art wise, and hast  doubtless seen many wars in the lands from whence thou camest--that is  if indeed they make wars in the Stars. Now tell us, what shall we do?  Twala has brought up many fresh men to take the place of those who have  fallen. Yet Twala has learnt his lesson; the hawk did not think to find  the heron ready; but our beak has pierced his breast; he fears to  strike at us again. We too are wounded, and he will wait for us to die;  he will wind himself round us like a snake round a buck, and fight the  fight of 'sit down.'"    "I hear thee," I said.    "So, Macumazahn, thou seest we have no water here, and but a little  food, and we must choose between these three things--to languish like a  starving lion in his den, or to strive to break away towards the north,  or"--and here he rose and pointed towards the dense mass of our  foes--"to launch ourselves straight at Twala's throat. Incubu, the  great warrior--for to-day he fought like a buffalo in a net, and  Twala's soldiers went down before his axe like young corn before the  hail; with these eyes I saw it--Incubu says 'Charge'; but the Elephant  is ever prone to charge. Now what says Macumazahn, the wily old fox,  who has seen much, and loves to bite his enemy from behind? The last  word is in Ignosi the king, for it is a king's right to speak of war;  but let us hear thy voice, O Macumazahn, who watchest by night, and the  voice too of him of the transparent eye."    "What sayest thou, Ignosi," I asked.    "Nay, my father," answered our quondam servant, who now, clad as he was  in the full panoply of savage war, looked every inch a warrior king,
