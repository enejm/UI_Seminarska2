  But that was not all.  What of his joy, the great love in him, ever  surging and struggling to express itself, succeeded in finding a new  mode of expression.  He suddenly thrust his head forward and nudged his  way in between the master's arm and body.  And here, confined, hidden  from view all except his ears, no longer growling, he continued to nudge  and snuggle.    The two men looked at each other.  Scott's eyes were shining.
