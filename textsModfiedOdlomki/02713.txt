  We entered 1,000,000 B. C. A movement of Migul, the mechanism,  attracted my attention. He left us at the window and went to his  controls.    "What is it?" I demanded.    "I am retarding us. We have been traveling very fast. One million  years and a few thousand are all which remain before we must stop."    I had noticed once or twice before that Migul had turned to gaze  through the Time-telespectroscope. Now he said:    "We are again followed!"    But he would say no more than that, and he silenced me harshly when I  questioned.    Suddenly, Mary touched me. "That little mirror on the table--look! It  holds an image!"

And then it was an ape-like man!  Mankind, here at last! Man, the Killer! Of all the beasts, this new  thing called man, most relentless of killers, had come here now to  struggle upward and dominate his world! This man-like ape in a quarter  of a million years became an ape-like man.    250,000 B. C. and the Heidelberg man, a little less ape-like, wandered
