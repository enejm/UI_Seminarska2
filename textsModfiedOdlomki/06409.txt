and they were sure to shut and bolt the door.  I might conceal myself  among the barrels inside; but apart from the fact that they were likely  to search them before beginning their conference, it was quite certain  that they would satisfy themselves that I was safe in the other end of  the building before going to the outhouse.    Suddenly I thought of the cellar which we had built below the store.  There was an entrance by a trap-door behind the counter, and another in  the outhouse.
