 through a sheen of amethyst.  The artillery were busy all around the  horizon, and towards the pass on the other road, where Fort Palantuken  stood, there was the dust and smoke of a furious bombardment. It seemed  to me, too, that the guns on the other fronts had come nearer.  Deve  Boyun was hidden by a spur of hill, but up in the north, white clouds,  like the streamers of evening, were hanging over the Euphrates glen.  The whole firmament hummed and twanged like a taut string that has been  struck ...    As I looked, the gun to the west fired--the gun where Stumm was.  The  shell dropped ten yards to our right.  A second later another fell  behind us.    Blenkiron had dragged himself to the parapet.  I don't suppose he had  ever been shelled before, but his face showed curiosity rather than  fear.

We crouched below the parapet again.  'We may as well toss for it,' I  said.  'There's only two ways--to stay here and be shelled or try to
