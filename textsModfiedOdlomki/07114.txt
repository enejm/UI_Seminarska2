  Now he turned directly toward the spot at which they had entered the  jungle.  He no longer cared whether he was observed or not.  There were  two reasons for his indifference.  The first was that he saw in Baynes'  act a counterpart of his own planned abduction of the girl.  In some  way he might turn the thing to his own purposes.  At least he would  keep in touch with them and make sure that Baynes did not get her.  His  other reason was based on his knowledge of an event that had transpired  at his camp the previous night--an event which he had not mentioned at  the bungalow for fear of drawing undesired attention to his movements  and bringing the blacks of the big Bwana into dangerous intercourse  with his own boys.  He had told at the bungalow that half his men had  deserted.  That story might be quickly disproved should his boys and  Bwana's grow confidential.    The event that he had failed to mention and which now urged him  hurriedly after the girl and her escort had occurred during his absence  early the preceding evening.  His men had been sitting around their  camp fire, entirely encircled by a high, thorn boma, when, without the  slightest warning, a huge lion had leaped amongst them and seized one  of their number.  It had been solely due to the loyalty and courage of  his comrades that his life had been saved, and then only after a battle  royal with the hunger-enraged beast had they been able to drive him off  with burning brands, spears, and rifles.    From this Hanson knew that a man eater had wandered into the district  or been developed by the aging of one of the many lions who ranged the  plains and hills by night, or lay up in the cool wood by day.  He had  heard the roaring of a hungry lion not half an hour before, and there  was little doubt in his mind but that the man eater was stalking Meriem  and Baynes.  He cursed the Englishman for a fool, and spurred rapidly  after them.
