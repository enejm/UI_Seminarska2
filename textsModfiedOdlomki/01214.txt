risen, bodily. Yet, they were still a long way below me; for the rock,  over the mouth of the pit, on which this house stands, arches up to a  great height.    It was later, that I noticed a change in the constant color of the  gardens. The pale, dirty green was growing ever paler and paler, toward  white. At last, after a great space, they became greyish-white, and  stayed thus for a very long time. Finally, however, the greyness began  to fade, even as had the green, into a dead white. And this remained,  constant and unchanged. And by this I knew that, at last, snow lay upon  all the Northern world.    And so, by millions of years, time winged onward through eternity, to  the end--the end, of which, in the old-earth days, I had thought  remotely, and in hazily speculative fashion. And now, it was approaching  in a manner of which none had ever dreamed.    I recollect that, about this time, I began to have a lively, though  morbid, curiosity, as to what would happen when the end came--but I  seemed strangely without imaginings.    All this while, the steady process of decay was continuing. The few  remaining pieces of glass, had long ago vanished; and, every now and  then, a soft thud, and a little cloud of rising dust, would tell of some  fragment of fallen mortar or stone.    I looked up again, to the fiery sheet that quaked in the heavens above  me and far down into the Southern sky. As I looked, the impression was  borne in upon me, that it had lost some of its first brilliancy--that it  was duller, deeper hued.    I glanced down, once more, to the blurred white of the worldscape.  Sometimes, my look returned to the burning sheet of dulling flame, that  was, and yet hid, the sun. At times, I glanced behind me, into the  growing dusk of the great, silent room, with its aeon-carpet of  sleeping dust....    So, I watched through the fleeting ages, lost in soul-wearing thoughts  and wonderings, and possessed with a new weariness.        _XVII_
