Martin blacking-bottle.  The glow of the red charcoal as it went from  hand to hand lit up the narrow, blinking eyes, the high Chinese  cheek-bones, and the bull-throats that melted away into the dark duffle  folds round the shoulders.  They looked like kobolds from some magic  mine--gnomes of the hills in conclave.  And while they talked, the  voices of the snow-waters round them diminished one by one as the  night-frost choked and clogged the runnels.    'How he stood up against us!'  said a Spiti man admiring.  'I remember  an old ibex, out Ladakh-way, that Dupont Sahib missed on a  shoulder-shot, seven seasons back, standing up just like him.  Dupont  Sahib was a good shikarri.'    'Not as good as Yankling Sahib.'  The Ao-chung man took a pull at the  whisky-bottle and passed it over.  'Now hear me--unless any other man  thinks he knows more.'    The challenge was not taken up.    'We go to Shamlegh when the moon rises.  There we will fairly divide  the baggage between us.  I am content with this new little rifle and  all its cartridges.'    'Are the bears only bad on thy holding?  said a mate, sucking at the  pipe.    'No; but musk-pods are worth six rupees apiece now, and thy women can  have the canvas of the tents and some of the cooking-gear.  We will do  all that at Shamlegh before dawn.  Then we all go our ways, remembering  that we have never seen or taken service with these Sahibs, who may,  indeed, say that we have stolen their baggage.'    'That is well for thee, but what will our Rajah say?'    'Who is to tell him?  Those Sahibs, who cannot speak our talk, or the  Babu, who for his own ends gave us money?  Will he lead an army against  us?  What evidence will remain?  That we do not need we shall throw on  Shamlegh-midden, where no man has yet set foot.'    'Who is at Shamlegh this summer?'  The place was only a grazing centre  of three or four huts.'
