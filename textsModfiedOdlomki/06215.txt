The gorge evidently had begun life as a layer of  soft, partly soluble stone in the cliffs, tilted upright by some  volcanic upheaval, and then worn completely away by the rushing stream.  Both cliff faces were of the harder rock, and were sheer and as smooth  as if they had been polished by hand. Here and there a network of tough  vines had begun to climb them, but nowhere did such a network even come  close to reaching the top.
