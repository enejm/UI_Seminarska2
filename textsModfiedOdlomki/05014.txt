   Phil Kaufman didn't answer. There was a pause and she said, "This  afternoon you're working with the microscope, and last night it was the  telescope. You were in the observatory until dawn."    "How did you find that out?"    "I have my methods, Watson. I don't see how you expect to keep going on  no sleep at all. Russ is worried about you."    "Pro or con?"    "Pro, of course. He likes you very much. In fact, he thinks you are the  best brain on the faculty."    "Coming from the president, that's praise indeed." Phil got up and went  to a desk, where he looked at some notes. "Speaking as my boss's wife,  would you say he was pro or con about this work I'm doing?"    "I would say he can't make it out. Alternating between the Microcosm  and the Macrocosm. Incidentally, why don't they call that thing in  the observatory a macroscope? I don't think Russ is very good at  understanding the unfamiliar. I was telling him about the concept of  hyper-time the other day, and his reaction was one of solicitude--he  got me a drink." Katherine stretched her arms. "What are you doing now?"    "Checking some figures. You know, that was odd, your bringing up the  business of hyper-time. This thing I'm working on seems to involve it."    "Oh?" Katherine put her arms behind her head again. "Tell me something,  Phil--what does he look like?"    "Doctor Russell Farley?"    "Yes. I suppose it's a funny sort of question to ask about one's  husband. How does he look to you?"    "Like the youngest college president in America, I guess. Brawny but  brainy. You make what they call a handsome couple."    "Yes, I was going to ask you what I looked like, only it's a waste of  time. People never tell you."    "I can," Phil said, "but I won't, for fear of giving you a swelled  head."    *       *       *       *       *
