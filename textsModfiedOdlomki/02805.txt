  "DID YOU HEAR ME?"    "Yes," admitted Junior.    The neighbors stared. The three maiden aunts clutched one another with  muted shrieks, savoring beforehand the language Pater would now use.    But Pater said "Ulp!"--no more.    "Now, dear," put in Mater quickly. "We must be patient. You know all  children go through larval stages."    "When I was a polyp ..." Pater began rustily. He coughed out an  accidentally inhaled crustacean, and started over: "No spawn of  mine...." Trailing off, he only glared, then roared abruptly, "SPRAT!"    "I won't!" said Junior reflexively and backpaddled into the coral  shadows of the reef.    "That wallop," seethed Pater, "wants a good polyping. I mean...." He  glowered suspiciously at Mater and the neighbors.    "Dear," soothed Mater, "didn't you _notice_?"    "Of course, I.... Notice what?"    "What Junior was doing ... carrying a stone.

"Intelligence, my dear," pronounced Pater, "is quite incompatible with  motility. Just think--how could ideas congeal in a brain shuttled  hither and yon, bombarded with ever-changing sense-impressions? Look  at the lower species, which swim about all their lives, incapable of  taking root or thought! True Intelligence, my dear--as distinguished  from Instinct, of course--pre-supposes the fixed viewpoint!" He paused.    Mater murmured, "Yes, dear," as she always did obediently at this point.
