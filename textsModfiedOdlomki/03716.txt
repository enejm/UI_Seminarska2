   *       *       *       *       *    Muldoon spent a busy Thursday. A newsbrief in the _Times_ financial  section which told of a public utility wanting Island property gave him  an idea for one thing. He spent all morning bringing the idea to a head,  after he had verified the truth of the item. Then, after a late lunch,  he went to the Treasury Department's headquarters and spent a couple of  hours with the head of the local investigation department.    He was quite pleased with himself by nightfall, as he headed out to the  Island. This time he parked the car at a considerable distance from the  shack. There were lights on, this night. He walked boldly up and knocked  at the door. It opened wide and the thick figure of one of the twins  darkened the opening.    "Well, Mr. Muldoon. I did not think to see you till Friday."    "I thought I'd come and see you tonight," Muldoon said as he stepped  into the room.    "I didn't hear the car."    "Oh. Parked it back a bit," Muldoon said. He turned toward the other  twin as the inner door opened. "Hello."    "Hello."    "You know, Evin," Robert said, "I'm rather glad Muldoon stopped by  tonight. We might as well conclude our business with him now."    "An excellent idea, Robert. Excellent."    "What do you mean?" Muldoon asked. "I no longer am acting for you?"    "Not for us, for yourself. I'm afraid your services, in any capacity,  will no longer be needed."    Muldoon caught the undercurrent of menace in Robert's voice. It told him  they were not only suspicious but ready to act on it. He started to edge  toward the door, but Robert suddenly reached out and took his arm. There  was power in the fat man's grip. Evin moved swiftly for his size, and  took up a position before the door, which he kicked shut.
