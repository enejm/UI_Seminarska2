 you, Carse, and me, and also Master Scientist Eliot Leithgow." He let  the words sink in. "Will you follow me?"    And so they went below again, down the spider ladder into the corridor.  There was nothing else to do: the guards, ever watchful, pressed close  behind. But a tattoo of alarm was beating in Hawk Carse's brain. Eliot  Leithgow again--the hint of something ominous to be aimed at him, Carse,  for the extraction of information he alone possessed: the whereabouts of  his elderly friend the Master Scientist.          CHAPTER V    _The Color-Storm_      The corridor was stopped by a heavy metal door. As the small party  approached, it swung inward in two halves, and a figure clad in a white  surgeon's smock emerged.
