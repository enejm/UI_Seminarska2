He examined his gas-mask from force of habit  before stepping out into the fog once more, then contemptuously threw it  aside. "Gas-masks, hell! Ain't worth havin'. Come on."    Corporal Wallis followed as he emerged from the little round cone of  the pill-box.    The gray mist that was fog-gas hung over everything. There was a  definite breeze blowing, but the mist was so dense that it did not seem  to move. It was far enough from the fog-flares for the last least trace  of striation to have vanished.

Here, fifteen miles down wind from the flares, it was possible to see  clearly in a circle approximately five feet in diameter. At the edge of  that circle outlines began to blur. At ten feet all shapes were the  faintest of bulks, the dimmest of outlines. At fifteen feet all was  invisible, hidden behind a screen of mist.    "Cast around," said Coffee gloomily.

At three yards distance they could make each other out as dim  outlines, no more. But it did not even occur to them to deplore the  mist.
