him.    "That bright star went out," she said; and Harkness let his gaze  follow where she pointed.    The stars that were distant suns shone in brilliant points of light;  no atmosphere here to dim them or cause a flickering. A bright point  vanished as she looked--another!--and he knew abruptly that he was  seeing a circle of blackness that moved slowly between them and the  stars.    "The Moon!" he shouted. "The Dark Moon!" And now his hand found the  controls that threw their ship into thunderous life. It was  approaching! He swung the metal ball to throw them ahead and to one  side, and the roar from the stern told of the fast-growing speed that  was pressing them to the floor....    *       *       *       *       *    An hour of wild flight, and the circle was close upon them. Too  faintly lighted to register in the telescopes of Earth, there was  still enough of luminosity to mark it as a round disc of violet that  grew dimly bluish-green around the edge.    It ceased to grow. Their ship, Harkness knew, was speeding beside it  some hundreds of miles away. But they were within its gravitational  pull, and were falling toward it. And he aimed his ship bow-on to make  the forward blast a check upon their falling speed.    The circle broadened; became a sphere; and then they were plunging  through clouds more tenuous than any vapors of Earth--thick layers of  gas that reflected no rays from the distant sun.

He made a  mental note of the fact, but his thoughts flashed again to what lay  ahead.    Every eye was held close to the lookouts that faced forward. The three
