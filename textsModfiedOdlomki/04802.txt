took her in his arms. "I know how tough it is. It's bad enough for me,  and probably worse for you. But at least we're sure they'll never be  bomb fodder. And we still have Joanna."    *       *       *       *       *    She twisted away from him, her voice suddenly bitter. "Don't give me  that Pollyanna stuff, Jim. 'Goody, goody, only a broken leg.
