My irritation lasted through dinner, which I had at a restaurant in  Jermyn Street.  I was no longer hungry, and let several courses pass  untasted.  I drank the best part of a bottle of Burgundy, but it did  nothing to cheer me.  An abominable restlessness had taken possession  of me.  Here was I, a very ordinary fellow, with no particular brains,  and yet I was convinced that somehow I was needed to help this business  through--that without me it would all go to blazes.  I told myself it  was sheer silly conceit, that four or five of the cleverest people  living, with all the might of the British Empire at their back, had the  job in hand.  Yet I couldn't be convinced.  It seemed as if a voice  kept speaking in my ear, telling me to be up and doing, or I would  never sleep again.    The upshot was that about half-past nine I made up my mind to go to  Queen Anne's Gate.  Very likely I would not be admitted, but it would  ease my conscience to try.    I walked down Jermyn Street, and at the corner of Duke Street passed a  group of young men.  They were in evening dress, had been dining  somewhere, and were going on to a music-hall.  One of them was Mr  Marmaduke Jopley.    He saw me and stopped short.    'By God, the murderer!' he cried.  'Here, you fellows, hold him!  That's Hannay, the man who did the Portland Place murder!'  He gripped  me by the arm, and the others crowded round.  I wasn't looking for any  trouble, but my ill-temper made me play the fool.  A policeman came up,  and I should have told him the truth, and, if he didn't believe it,  demanded to be taken to Scotland Yard, or for that matter to the  nearest police station.  But a delay at that moment seemed to me  unendurable, and the sight of Marmie's imbecile face was more than I  could bear.  I let out with my left, and had the satisfaction of seeing  him measure his length in the gutter.
