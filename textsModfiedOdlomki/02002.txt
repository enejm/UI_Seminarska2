saturated with moisture. Even the fire pellets could not make it burn.    "HOOM! HOOM! HOOM! HOOM! HOOM! HOOM! HOOM!"    The six-shooter! He had forgotten it. He jerked it from its holster  and pointed it at the red throat, emptied all the chambers. He saw the  flash of yellow flame, felt the recoil, but the sound of the  discharges was drowned in the Brobdignagian tumult. He drew back his  arm to throw the useless toy from him. But again that unexplainable,  senseless "hunch" restrained him. He reloaded the gun and returned it  to its holster.    "HOOM! HOOM! HOOM! HOOM! HOOM! HOOM!"    A thought had been struggling to reach his consciousness against the  pressure of the unbearable noise. The fire pellets! Couldn't they be  used in some way? These small chemical spheres, no larger than the end  of his little finger, had long ago supplanted actual fire along the  frontiers, where electricity was not available for cooking. In contact  with moisture they emitted terrific heat, a radiant heat which  penetrated meat, bone, and even metal. One such pellet would cook a  meal in ten minutes, with no sign of scorching or burning. And they  had several hundred in one of the standard moisture-proof containers.    *       *       *       *       *    As fast as his fingers could work the trigger of the dispenser  Forepaugh dropped the potent little pellets down the bellowing throat.  He managed to release about thirty before the bellowing stopped. A  veritable tornado of energy broke loose at the foot of the tree. The  giant maw was closed, and the shocking silence was broken only by the  thrashing of a giant body in its death agonies. The radiant heat,  penetrating through and through the beast's body, withered nearby  vegetation and could be easily felt on the perch up the tree.    Gunga was slowly recovering. His iron constitution helped him to rally  from the powerful blow he had received, and by the time the jungle was  still he was sitting up mumbling apologies.
