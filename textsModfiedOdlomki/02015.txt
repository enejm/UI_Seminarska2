  The plane in which he and Jamison and Paula had escaped in was  floating out in the harbor. It was unmistakable. A larger, bulkier  seaplane floated beside it. The buzzing in the air the night  before.... The arrival of the plane had been telephoned from Cape  Virgins. Through a glass, perhaps, even its alighting had been  watched. And a big seaplane had gone out to bring it back. Footprints  in the sand would lead toward the lighthouse. There would be plenty of  men to storm that, if necessary, to take the three fugitives. But they  would have found only Paula. It was quite possible that the plane had  only been sent for after Bell and Jamison had been seen to land in  Punta Arenas. And Paula in The Master's hands would explain Ribiera's  amusement perfectly.    *       *       *       *       *    Bell found Jamison looking unhurriedly for him.

Jamison stared. Bell's manner was almost entirely normal again. Then  Jamison shrugged.    "The sense of what you're saying," he observed wryly, "is that we're
