  _A stamp lying on my desk was an inspiration. I licked it, turned it gum  side up, and cautiously pressed the little man against it feet first.  With the thought, "That ought to hold him," I dashed upstairs to answer  the call._    _But it didn't hold him. There was quite a bit of strength in that tiny  body._    "Miserable fate!
