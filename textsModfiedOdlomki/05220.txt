 But to try to pass through the port--that was bad judgment. It was only  necessary for Carse to hold bead on it and fire when they passed in  line.    This was the present "luck" of the adventurer. He might have sniped the  guards anyway, but he had it easier. From fifty yards away, prone and  carefully sighting, he took the three lives that had been so viciously,  so subversively altered by Ku Sui.
