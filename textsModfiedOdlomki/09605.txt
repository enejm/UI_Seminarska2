“He’s a bigger man than I thought,” said another.    “So he had a good jaw under that beard after all,” commented a third.    “The pictures of him aren’t handsome enough,” declared a pretty girl,  taking great care that I should hear. No doubt it was mere flattery.    But, in spite of these signs of approval and interest, the mass of  the people received me in silence and with sullen looks, and my dear  brother’s portrait ornamented most of the windows--which was an ironical  sort of greeting to the King.
