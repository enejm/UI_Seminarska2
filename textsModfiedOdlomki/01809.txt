  Asher shrugged, and through half-closed lids he eyed Lee Wong and the  rather small, slender Krenski, of the high brow and large head. Then  he walked ahead of them. Head up, shoulders back, he walked carelessly  down the wide hall--a hall that led into the main cavern of that  underground empire.    It was large--fully a hundred feet in a rough square. Not fifteen feet  from floor to ceiling at any point, it followed the course of the two  layers of granite between which it was sandwiched. Other long halls,  or crevices, ran in every direction out of this main cavern. In the  walls, in niches and cracks, the superior pressure lamps had been  placed, throwing a bright, eery light over it all.    Asher recoiled suddenly at the sight of hundreds of Petrolia that  swarmed the hallways, and they seemed to sense another presence beside  that of Lee Wong or Krenski.

If we were working  from above, now, we would run it to a central shaft, and pump it out.  We do not want it on the surface, however."    *       *       *       *       *    "Then why in the name of hell do you want it?" Asher barked, a tense  note of anger in his voice.
