Needless to say we scrambled towards him quickly enough.    "Quatermain, put your hand here where mine is. Now, do you feel  anything?"    "I _think_ I feel air coming up."    "Now listen." He rose and stamped upon the place, and a flame of hope  shot up in our hearts. _It rang hollow._    With trembling hands I lit a match. I had only three left, and we saw  that we were in the angle of the far corner of the chamber, a fact that  accounted for our not having noticed the hollow sound of the place  during our former exhaustive examination.
