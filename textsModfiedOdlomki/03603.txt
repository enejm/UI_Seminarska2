violent electrical storm which lasted into the early morning.    Dan spent the whole night nauseously gripping the edge of his bunk, his  legs braced against the violent heave and lurch of the trawler.    Before dawn of the next day, aching in every muscle, his insides sore  and tender, his mind fuzzy from lack of sleep, Dan was set ashore on a  dark, quiet and foggy strip of beach. He stood for a moment in the soft  sand, feeling it seem to dip underfoot.    This, he thought, was undoubtedly the worst start he had ever made on  any planet anywhere.    From around him in the impenetrable fog came distant croakings,  whistlings and hisses. The sounds were an unpleasant suggestion that  something else had gone wrong. Between bouts of sickness, Dan had tried  to arrange with the crew to land him near the outskirts of a Porcyn  city. But the sounds were those of the open country.    What Dan wanted was to go through the outskirts of the city before  many people were moving around. He could learn a great deal from their  homes, their means of transportation and the actions of a few early  risers. He could learn from the things he expected to see, or from the  lack of them, _if_ he was there to see them.    Dan moved slowly inland, crossed a ditch and came to what seemed to  be a macadam road. He checked his directions and started to walk. He  forced the pace so his breath came hard, and hoped it would pump some  life into his dulled brain and muscles.    As his senses gradually began to waken, Dan became aware of an odd  _swish-swish, swish-swish_, like a broom dusting lightly over the  pavement behind him. The sound drew steadily closer.    Dan halted abruptly.    The sound stopped, too.    He walked on.    _Swish-swish._    He whirled.    Silence.    *       *       *       *       *
