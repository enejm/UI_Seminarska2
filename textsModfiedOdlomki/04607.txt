"Perhaps," said Zotul, "it is a good thing also, as you said before,  and will result in something even better for us."    Koltan frowned, and Zotul, in fear of another beating, instantly  subsided.    "They are replacing our high-quality ceramic ware with inferior  terrestrial junk," Koltan went on bitterly. "It is only the glamor that  sells it, of course, but before the people get the shine out of their  eyes, we can be ruined."
