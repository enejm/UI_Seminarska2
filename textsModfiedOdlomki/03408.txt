When he got to the street, he found he  was shaking, and badly in need of a drink.    *       *       *       *       *    Fraser asked, "Jim, did you ever read _Trilby_?"

Change emotional attitudes, just like that." Fraser  snapped his fingers.    "I don't know," said Sworsky. "Nuclear cross-sections are more in my  line. But offhand, I should imagine it might be done ... sometime in the  far future. Thought-habits, associational-patterns, the labeling of this  as good and that as bad, seem to be matters of established neural paths.  If you could selectively alter the polarization of individual  neurones--But it's a pretty remote prospect; we hardly know a thing  about the brain today."    He studied his friend sympathetically.

"But this--Look, let me tell you all I've  found out."    Sworsky shook his head at the end of the story. "That's a mighty wild  speculation," he murmured. "I'd forget it if I were you."    "Did you know Kennedy's old partner? Gavotti, at Chicago."    "Sure, I met him a few times. Nice old guy, very unworldly, completely  wrapped up in his work. He got interested in neurology from the physics  angle toward the end of his life, and contributed a lot to cybernetics.  What of it?"    "I don't know," said Fraser; "I just don't know. But do me a favor, will  you, Jim? Judy won't see me at all, but she knows you and likes you. Ask
