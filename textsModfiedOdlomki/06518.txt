Then an idea struck me.  'Is there no Inspector of Coastguards or some  fellow like that who knows the East Coast?'    Whittaker said there was, and that he lived in Clapham.  He went off in  a car to fetch him, and the rest of us sat about the little room and  talked of anything that came into our heads.  I lit a pipe and went  over the whole thing again till my brain grew weary.    About one in the morning the coastguard man arrived.  He was a fine old  fellow, with the look of a naval officer, and was desperately  respectful to the company.
