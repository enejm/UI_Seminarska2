The problem, therefore, was how to link the explorations of Burton  and Speke with those of Dr. Barth, since to do so was to undertake to  traverse an extent of more than twelve degrees of territory.        CHAPTER FIFTH.    Kennedy’s Dreams.--Articles and Pronouns in the Plural.--Dick’s  Insinuations.--A Promenade over the Map of Africa.--What is contained  between two Points of the Compass.--Expeditions now on foot.--Speke and  Grant.--Krapf, De Decken, and De Heuglin.    Dr. Ferguson energetically pushed the preparations for his departure,  and in person superintended the construction of his balloon, with  certain modifications; in regard to which he observed the most absolute  silence. For a long time past he had been applying himself to the study  of the Arab language and the various Mandingoe idioms, and, thanks to  his talents as a polyglot, he had made rapid progress.    In the mean while his friend, the sportsman, never let him out of his  sight--afraid, no doubt, that the doctor might take his departure,  without saying a word to anybody. On this subject, he regaled him with  the most persuasive arguments, which, however, did NOT persuade Samuel  Ferguson, and wasted his breath in pathetic entreaties, by which the  latter seemed to be but slightly moved. In fine, Dick felt that the  doctor was slipping through his fingers.    The poor Scot was really to be pitied. He could not look upon the azure  vault without a sombre terror: when asleep, he felt oscillations that  made his head reel; and every night he had visions of being swung aloft  at immeasurable heights.    We must add that, during these fearful nightmares, he once or twice fell  out of bed. His first care then was to show Ferguson a severe contusion  that he had received on the cranium. “And yet,” he would add, with  warmth, “that was at the height of only three feet--not an inch  more--and such a bump as this! Only think, then!”    This insinuation, full of sad meaning as it was, did not seem to touch  the doctor’s heart.    “We’ll not fall,” was his invariable reply.    “But, still, suppose that we WERE to fall!”
