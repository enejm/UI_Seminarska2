The nineteenth century, in fact, by making education popular, has  produced in America the curious spectacle of a reading-public with  essentially nonliterary tastes.  Formerly, better books were published,  because they were intended for persons who turned to reading through a  natural bent of mind; whereas the modern American novel of commerce is  addressed to us average people who read, when we read at all, in  violation of every innate instinct.    Such grounds as yet exist for hopefulness on the part of those who  cordially care for _belles lettres_ are to be found elsewhere than in  the crowded market-places of fiction, where genuine intelligence  panders on all sides to ignorance and indolence.

The book, in fine, simply irritates the serious-minded person;
