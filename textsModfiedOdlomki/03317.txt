  Strength came. I glanced cautiously along the dim-lit corridor, and  it was empty and silent. I stole out and hurried toward the ultrabeam  shack. My hidden switch was on the way; I threw it and ran on with  lowered head.    The siren screamed behind me, before me, around me, the howling of  all the devils in hell--_Hoo! hoo! Battle stations! Strange ships  approaching! Battle stations! All hands to battle stations! Hoo-oo!_    I could imagine the pandemonium that erupted, men boiling out of  factories and rooms, cursing and yelling and dashing frantically for  their posts--children screaming in terror, women white-faced with  sudden numbness--weapons manned, instruments sweeping the skies,  spaceships roaring heavenward, incoherent yelling on the intercoms to  find out who had given that signal. With luck, I would have fifteen  minutes or half an hour of safe insanity.    A few men raced by me, on their way to the nearest missile rack. They  paid me no heed, and I hurried along my own path.    The winding stair leading up to the ultrabeam shack loomed before me.  I went its length, three steps at a time, bounding and gasping with my  haste, up to the transmitter.    It was the tenuous link binding together a score of rebel planets, the  only communication with the stars that glittered so coldly overhead.  The ultrabeam does not have an infinite velocity, but it does have  an unlimited speed, one depending solely on the frequency of the  generating equipment, and since it only goes to such receivers as are  tuned to its pattern--there must be at least one such tuned unit for  the generator to work--it has a virtually infinite range. So men can  talk between the stars, but are their words the wiser for that?    *       *       *       *       *    Up and up and up, round and round, up and up, metal clanging underfoot  and always the demon screech of the siren--up!    I sprang from the head of the stairs and crossed the areaway in one
