forever beneath a mask of steel, exiled to a country where the men  seemed little more than slaves of the elements; Philippe, deprived  even of the society of D’Artagnan, who had loaded him with honors and  delicate attentions, had nothing more to see than odious specters in  this world, and, despair beginning to devour him, he poured himself  forth in complaints, in the belief that his revelations would raise up  some avenger for him. The manner in which the musketeer had been near  killing his two best friends, the destiny which had so strangely brought  Athos to participate in the great state secret, the farewell of Raoul,  the obscurity of the future which threatened to end in a melancholy  death; all this threw D’Artagnan incessantly back on lamentable  predictions and forebodings, which the rapidity of his pace did not  dissipate, as it used formerly to do.

Towards the end of his career, at the moment of  reaching the goal, like the patrician Fuscus, he had made a false step  upon a plank, and had fallen into the sea. But Porthos, good, harmless  Porthos! To see Porthos hungry, to see Mousqueton without gold lace,  imprisoned, perhaps; to see Pierrefonds, Bracieux, razed to the very  stones, dishonored even to the timber,--these were so many poignant
