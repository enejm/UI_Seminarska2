   “To the Hesea of the College on the Mountain, known as Ayesha upon  earth, and in the household of the Over-world whence she has been  permitted to wander, as ‘Star-that-hath-fallen--’”      “A pretty sounding name, forsooth,” broke in Ayesha; “ah! but, Atene,  set stars rise again--even from the Under-world. Read on, thou Oros.”      “Greetings, O Ayesha. Thou who art very old, hast gathered much wisdom  in the passing of the centuries, and with other powers, that of making  thyself seem fair in the eyes of men blinded by thine arts.

Perhaps the Khania  does but think to frighten me with a cunning lie, but if she has read  aright, then be sure, beloved, that it is still well with us, since none  can escape their destiny, nor can our bond of union which was fashioned  with the universe that bears us, ever be undone.”    She paused awhile then went on with a sudden outburst of poetic thought
