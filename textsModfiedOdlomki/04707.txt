  Jean shook his head. "No, he's writing superlatively."    "Then what _is_ the problem?" she asked, now thoroughly mystified.    "He's writing classics!" burst out Jean in baffled irritation. "He won't  write anything else! Easily seeing the approaching catastrophe, I wrote  long persuading essays to him. It was pathetically useless. Proudly he  continued to write his _Rise and Fall of the Western Plainsman_ in a  lucid, passionate prose which would evoke an imperishable picture--but  in three thousand pages."    "I think classics are _nice_," protested Judy, "and one of these days  I'm going to read another one."    Huskily Jean told her the worst. "Writing classics consumes paper by the  ton. And if you ever get your 750,000 word story finished, you must then  start shrinking it back to an acceptable 75,000 words. This is a nearly  hopeless task. Of course if you can get it back to 75,000 words the  digest magazines will have no trouble shrinking it to 15,000 words or  fifteen pictures, and you then get your fingers in the till." He paused  and all hope fled from his face. "Droozle won't live nearly long enough  to get all of that shrinking done. And in the meantime that scribbling  snake is writing me out of house and home!"    "Are you going to let him get away with it?" the girl challenged.    *       *       *       *       *    "I don't know whether I am or not," replied the young artist, looking  worried. "I thought I had the problem solved at first. He got so sassy  when we were arguing about him writing classics that I had no hesitation  about applying a pinch of glue to his glittering little extremity. That  put him out of the writing business until he came to terms."    "Well, now. You _were_ enterprising!" she approved.    "It didn't do any good though," Jean grumbled despondently, bowing his  head.    "He wouldn't bargain?" she asked incredulously.    "He didn't have to. He knew right where the cheese grater was."
