been tied up for fifteen minutes. I finally decided to get off the bus  and walk, even though it is about a hundred in the shade."    "Come along to the shop," I suggested. "The reception room is  air-conditioned and you can watch the world's first baseball game  telecast in color. The Giants versus the Dodgers, Carl Erskine  pitching."    Marge brightened. "That'll be more fun than shopping, won't it, Doreen?"  she asked, looking down at the kid. "Bill, this is Doreen. She lives  across the street from me. Her mother's at the dentist and I said I'd  look after her for the day."    "Hello, Doreen," I said. "What have you in the hatbox? Doll clothes?"    Doreen gave me a look of faint disgust. "No," she piped, in a high  treble. "An unhappy genii."    "An unhappy--" I did a double take. "Oh, an unhappy genii? Maybe he's  unhappy because you won't let him out, ha ha." Even to myself, I sounded  idiotic.    Doreen looked at me pityingly. "It's not a he, it's a thing. Elmer made  it."    I knew when I was losing, so I quit.    *       *       *       *       *    I hurried Marge and Doreen along toward our little two-story building.  Once we got into the air-conditioned reception room, Marge sank down  gratefully onto the settee and I switched on the television set with the  big 24-inch tube Tom had built.    Biltom Electronics makes TV components, computer parts, things like  that. Tom Kennedy is the brains. Me, Bill Rawlins, I do the legwork, and  tend to the business details.    "It's uncanny the way all those cars suddenly stopped when our bus broke  down," Marge said as we waited for the picture to come on. "Any day now  this civilization of ours will get so complicated a bus breaking down  someplace will bring the whole thing to a halt. Then where will we be?"    "Elmer says silly-zation is doomed!" Doreen put in happily.
