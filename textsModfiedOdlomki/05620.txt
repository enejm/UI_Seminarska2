 and with every foot the watching bodies became visibly bolder. There  was no light inside the torpoon--inner light would decrease the  visibility outside--but Ken knew her controls as does the musician his  instrument. Slowly the propeller whirled over, the torpoon dropped,  slowly the diffused light from the hole above diminished--and slowly  the eager wall of sealmen followed and crept in.    Twenty-five feet down; and then, after a long time, thirty-five feet,  and forty. Seventy feet up, in all, to the hole in the ice....    Ken wanted seventy-five feet, but he could not have it. For the wall  of sleek bodies broke. One or two of the creatures surged forward;  other followed; they were coming!    The slim torpoon leaped under the unleashed power of her  motors--forward.    *       *       *       *       *    For one awful moment Ken thought he was finished. The vision of the  hole was obscured by a twisting, whirling maelstrom of bodies, and the  torpoon quivered and shook like a living thing in agony under glancing  blows.    But then came a patch of light, a pathway of light, leading straight  up at a forty-five-degree angle to the hole in the ice above.    Sealmen and torpoon had leaped forward at the same moment. Doubtless  the creatures had not expected the shell to move so suddenly and  decisively ahead, so that when it did, those in the van swerved to  escape head-on contact.    The torpoon gained speed all too slowly for her pilot. It naturally  took time to gain full forward speed from a standing start. But she  moved, and she moved fast, and after her poured the full tide of  sealmen, now that they saw their prey running in retreat.    From somewhere ahead appeared a rope, noosed to catch the fleeing  prey. It slipped off the side. Another touched the bow, but it too was  thrown off. The torpoon's forward momentum was now great; she was  sweeping up at the full speed Ken had gone back to be able to attain.
