and the crops of the vultures after they have ‘gone beyond’ by the  bridge of spears.”    Now, at this awful speech (which, both because of all that it implied of  bloodshed and civil war and of the wild, wailing voice in which it was  spoken, that seemed quite different from Zikali’s, caused everyone who  heard it, including myself, I am afraid, to gasp and shiver) the King  sprang from his stool as though to put a stop to such doctoring. Then,  after his fashion, he changed his mind and sat down again. But Zikali,  taking no heed, went to the third set of marks and studied them.    “It would seem,” he said, “that I am awakened from sleep in my Black  House yonder to tell of a very little matter, that might well have been  dealt with by any common Nyanga born but yesterday. Well, I have taken  my fee, and I will earn it, although I thought that I was brought here  to speak of great matters, such as the death of princes and the fortunes  of peoples. Is it desired that my Spirit should speak of wizardries in  this town of Nodwengu?”    “Izwa!” said the chorus in a loud voice.    Zikali nodded his great head and seemed to talk with the dust, waiting  now and again for an answer.    “Good,” he said; “they are many, and the dust has told them all to me.  Oh, they are very many”--and he glared around him--“so many that if I  spoke them all the hyenas of the hills would be full to-night--”    Here the audience began to show signs of great apprehension.    “But,” looking down at the dust and turning his head sideways, “what  do you say, what do you say? Speak more plainly, Little Voices, for you  know I grow deaf. Oh! now I understand. The matter is even smaller than  I thought. Just of one wizard--”    “Izwa!” (loudly).    “--just of a few deaths and some sicknesses.”    “Izwa!”    “Just of one death, one principal death.”    “Izwa!” (very loudly).    “Ah! So we have it--one death. Now, was it a man?”
