  "As I speak to you. At least, in a sense. They can project thoughts."    "I gathered that must be so from your letter. How, I wonder."    "I could not say. I asked them and, of course, they were vague. Or  perhaps it was just that I could not understand. It involves a projector  for the focussing of thought and, even more than that, conscious  attention on the part of both projector and receptor. It was quite a  while before I realized they were trying to think at me. Such  thought-projectors may be part of the science they will give us."    "Perhaps," said the Industrialist. "Yet think of the changes it would  bring to society. A thought-projector!"    "Why not? Change would be good for us."    "I don't think so."    "It is only in old age that change is unwelcome," said the Astronomer,  "and races can be old as well as individuals."    The Industrialist pointed out the window. "You see that road. It was  built Beforethewars. I don't know exactly when. It is as good now as the  day it was built. We couldn't possibly duplicate it now. The race was  young when that was built, eh?"    "Then? Yes! At least they weren't afraid of new things."    "No. I wish they had been. Where is the society of Beforethewars?  Destroyed, Doctor! What good were youth and new things? We are better  off now. The world is peaceful and jogs along. The race goes nowhere but  after all, there is nowhere to go. _They_ proved that. The men who built  the road. I will speak with your visitors as I agreed, if they come. But  I think I will only ask them to go."    "The race is not going nowhere," said the Astronomer, earnestly. "It is  going toward final destruction. My university has a smaller student body  each year. Fewer books are written. Less work is done. An old man sleeps  in the sun and his days are peaceful and unchanging, but each day finds  him nearer death all the same."    "Well, well," said the Industrialist.
