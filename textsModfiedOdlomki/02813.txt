grew confiding. "Now, Junior, once you're settled you'll realize the  importance of being easy in your mind about your offspring's parentage.  Remember, a niche in brine saves trying. Nothing like choosing your  location well in the first place. Study the currents around your  prospective site--particularly their direction and force at such  crucial times as flood-tide. Try to make sure you and your future mate  won't be too close down-current from anybody else's site, since in a  case like that accidents can happen. You understand, Junior?"

Judging by what they could see of it,  his homesite might even prove a credit to the colony (so went Pater's  thoughts) and attract a mate who would be a good catch (thus Mater  mused).    Junior was still to be seen at times along the reef in company with  his free-swimming friends among the other polyps, at some of whom
