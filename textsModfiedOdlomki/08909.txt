  STELLA    I was not slow to take Indaba-zimbi’s hint. About a hundred and fifty  yards to the left of the laager was a little dell where I had hidden  my horse, together with one belonging to the Boers, and my saddle and  bridle. Thither we went, I carrying the swooning Tota in my arms. To our  joy we found the horses safe, for the Zulus had not seen them.
