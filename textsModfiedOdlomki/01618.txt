 Doctor's desk. "I haven't got a case up my sleeve this time; I just came  in for a little chat."    "All right, glad to see you. Read that latest volume of the  _Zeitschrift_ for a while. That article of Von Beyer's has got me  guessing, all right."    Carnes picked up the indicated volume and settled himself to read. The  Doctor bent over his apparatus. Time and again he made minute  adjustments and gave vent to muttered exclamations of annoyance at the  results he obtained. Half an hour later he rose from his chair with a  sigh and turned to his visitor.    "What do you think of Von Beyer's alleged discovery?" he asked the  operative.    *       *       *       *       *    "It's too deep for me, Doctor," replied the operative. "All that I can  make out of it is that he claims to have discovered a new element named  'lunium,' but hasn't been able to isolate it yet. Is there anything  remarkable about that? It seems to me that I have read of other new  elements being discovered from time to time."    "There is nothing remarkable about the discovery of a new element by the  spectroscopic method," replied Dr. Bird. "We know from Mendeleff's  table that there are a number of elements which we have not discovered  as yet, and several of the ones we know were first detected by the  spectroscope. The thing which puzzles me is that so brilliant a man as  Von Beyer claims to have discovered it in the spectra of the moon. His  name, lunium, is taken from Luna, the moon."    "Why not the moon? Haven't several elements been first discovered in the  spectra of stars?"    "Certainly. The classic example is Lockyer's discovery of an orange line  in the spectra of the sun in 1868. No known terrestrial element gave  such a line and he named the new element which he deduced helium, from  Helos, the sun. The element helium was first isolated by Ramsey some
