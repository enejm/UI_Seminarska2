tiny transverse passage. The twin doors of A 22 and A 20 were before  me.    The invisible eavesdropper had gone into one of these rooms! I listened  at each of the panels, but there was only silence within.    The interior of the ship was suddenly singing with the steward's  siren--the call to awaken the passengers. It startled me. I moved  swiftly away. But as the siren shut off, in the silence I heard a soft,  musical voice:    "Wake up, Anita--I think that's the breakfast call."    And her answer: "All right, George. I hear it."      CHAPTER IV    _A Burn on a Martian Arm_    I did not appear at that morning meal. I was exhausted and drugged with  lack of sleep. I had a moment with Snap, to tell him what had occurred.  Then I sought out Carter. He had his little chart-room insulated. And we  were cautious. I told him what Snap and I had learned: the Gamma rays  from the moon, proving that Grantline had concentrated a considerable  ore-body. I also told him the message from Grantline.    "We'll stop on the way back, as he directs, Gregg." He bent closer to  me. "At Ferrok-Shahn I'm going to bring back a cordon of Interplanetary  Police. The secret will be out, of course, when once we stop at the  moon. We have no right, even now, to be flying this vessel as unguarded  as it is."    He was very solemn. And he was grim when I told him of the invisible  eavesdropper.    "You think he overheard Grantline's message?"    "I don't know," I said.    "Who was it? You seem to feel it was George Prince?"    "Yes."    I was convinced that the prowler had gone into A 20. When I mentioned  the purser, who seemed to have been watching me earlier in the night,  and again was sitting in the smoking room when the eavesdropper fled  past, Carter looked startled.    "Johnson is all right, Gregg."    "Is he? Does he know anything about this Grantline affair?"
