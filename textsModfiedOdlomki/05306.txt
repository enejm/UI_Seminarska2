circumference of Satellite III. Why, he would at once deduce that it  gave the precise location of my laboratory!"    *       *       *       *       *    The Hawk rose quickly. "If those papers fell into Dr. Ku's hands--"    "He would know exactly where the laboratory is," Leithgow finished.  "He would search. Its camouflage would not hold him long. And that  would be the end of my laboratory--and us too, if we were caught  inside."    "Yes," snapped the Hawk. "You imply that the papers were left in  Kurgo's house?"    "I had them in the bottom drawer of the clothes-chest in the room I  always use. The coolies did not take them. At that time they wanted  nothing but me."    Friday, rubbing his woolly crown, interjected: "But, even if Ku Sui's  still alive, he wouldn't know about them papers. Far's _I_ can see,  they're safe."    "No!" Leithgow cried. "That's it! They're not! Follow it logically,  point by point. Assuming that Dr. Ku's alive, he has one point of  contact with us--Kurgo's house, in Porno, where I was kidnapped. He  wants us badly. He will anticipate that one of us will go back to that  house: to care for Kurgo's body, to get my belongings--for several  reasons. So he will radio down--he probably can't come himself--for  henchmen to station themselves at the house and to ransack it  thoroughly for anything pertaining to me. The papers would fall into  their hands!"    "All right," said Carse levelly. "We must get those papers. They will  either be still in the house or in the possession of Dr. Ku's men at  Porno. But whichever it is--_we must get them before Ku Sui does_." He  paused.    "Well," he said, "that means me." He turned and looked down at the old  man and smiled. "There's no use risking the three of us. I'll go to  Kurgo's house myself."    "If the papers are gone, suh?" asked Friday.
