   "I wouldn't get that far," I grumbled.    "And I bet if somebody threw a knife at you, it would miss!" McGill  went on, ignoring me. "Here, I'd like to try an experiment...."    "Now, hold on!" I said.    "_McGill!_ Are you _crazy_?" Molly cried, but he ignored her also and  opened his desk drawer, from which he took a pair of dice.    "Roll me some sevens, Alec," he said, handing them to me.    "I thought we came here for a conference," I protested. "And I don't  know whether you know about it, but there's been a Village-wide  electric power failure and I'm being blamed, according to Bill Bart."    "Holy cow! When did you hear that?"

A crowd of two or  three hundred people was standing in the campus, staring up at the sky  over us.    "What are they looking at?" McGill asked. "No one can possibly know  we're here."    I started to lean out of the window, twisting up my head to see what it  could be.    "Don't do that, Alec! They'll see you!" McGill warned, and I pulled my  head in.    "Can we get on the roof?"
