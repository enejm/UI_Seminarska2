Now, once again, the prison-cage shuddered and lifted in an upward arc.  The Merchant rolled to the lower rim and startled awake. The cover  lifted and light flooded in. As was the case the time before, there were  two specimens of the young. They were not very different in appearance  from adults of the species, reflected the Explorer, though, of course,  they were considerably smaller.    A handful of reedy green stalks was stuffed between the bars. Its odor  was not unpleasant but it carried clods of soil at its ends.    The Merchant drew away and said, huskily, "What are they doing?"    The Explorer said, "Trying to feed us, I should judge. At least this  seems to be the native equivalent of grass."    The cover was replaced and they were set swinging again, alone with  their fodder.      IV    Slim started at the sound of footsteps and brightened when it turned out  to be only Red.    He said, "No one's around. I had my eye peeled, you bet."    Red said, "Ssh. Look. You take this stuff and stick it in the cage. I've  got to scoot back to the house."    "What is it?" Slim reached reluctantly.    "Ground meat. Holy Smokes, haven't you ever seen ground meat? That's  what you should've got when I sent you to the house instead of coming  back with that stupid grass."    Slim was hurt. "How'd I know they don't eat grass. Besides, ground meat  doesn't come loose like that. It comes in cellophane and it isn't that  color."    "Sure--in the city. Out here we grind our own and it's always this color  till it's cooked."    "You mean it isn't cooked?" Slim drew away quickly.    Red looked disgusted. "Do you think animals eat _cooked_ food. Come on,  take it. It won't hurt you. I tell you there isn't much time."    "Why? What's doing back at the house?"    "I don't know. Dad and your father are walking around. I think maybe  they're looking for me. Maybe the cook told them I took the meat.
