her amusement.    "I coped somehow," he answered sturdily. "Later he learned--after I  squeezed him on the liver a few times just to show him how--to switch to  a lovely shade of ochre, which was delightful on pale green or pink  paper. Why, what's the matter, Judy?"    "Go on," she choked. "Go go go!"    He beamed. "I write my letters with him too. Every day I wrote with him,  first in red, and then in ochre to give him a rest. He seemed to love to  write more than to sketch. He would jump into my hand with tail happily  pointed downward as I sat down to my writing desk. And when I later saw  his dark green stripes turning pastel and knew that anemia was imminent,  and started to lay him down for a earned rest, he would stiffen himself  as if to say, 'Oh, come, come! I'm good for half a page yet!'"    "It sounds as though he was a willing worker, but I still can't see why  his malfunction makes our marriage impossible."    "I haven't gotten to his career as a novelist yet. There lies the heart  of the tragedy."

His first message to the world  was, '_I hold that the supine viewpoint is seldom downward!_'"    "I don't see how he could stand up on end to write for very long, even  with such a magnificent philosophy to bolster him."    "What a terrible pun," Jean groaned. "He couldn't stand up very long at  first. But I saw he had talent. I gladly learned the skill of holding  him upright in a relaxed manner so that he could express himself on  paper. In no time at all, he had written what was to be his first,  sensational, best-selling shocker, _Naked Bellies in the Grass_."
