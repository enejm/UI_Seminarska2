happenstance would disturb the delicate balance of the energy  compensators and the course of the _Nomad_ would instantly alter to  dodge the foreign object. Once passed by, the course would again be  resumed."    "Some ship, the _Nomad_!" Carr was delighted with the explanations.  "I'm sold on her and on the trip. Where are we now and where bound?"    *       *       *       *       *    Mado glanced at the instrument board.

Out  between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, a quarter of a billion miles  away. But we'll average better than a thousand miles a second. Be  there in three days of your time."

Looks like seaweed or something; and Carr, I swear there are things  floating around in it. Wrecks. Something damn peculiar, anyway. I vow  I saw a signal. People marooned there or something. Sorta scared me  and I didn't stay around for long as there was an awful pull from the  mass. Had to use full reversal of the gravity force to get away."    "Now why didn't you tell me that before?

"No internal gravity mechanism on the
