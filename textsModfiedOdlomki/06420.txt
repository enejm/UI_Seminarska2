  'So he is dead,' he said at last, half-whispering to himself. 'Well, he  was a king, and died like a king.  Our job now is simple, for there is  none of his breed left in Africa.'    Then I told him of the treasure.    'It belongs to you, Davie,' he said, 'and we must see that you get it.  This is going to be a long war, but if we survive to the end you will  be a rich man.'
