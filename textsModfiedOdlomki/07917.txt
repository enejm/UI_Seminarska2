chateau.        Chapter LV. Happy as a Prince.    At the very moment he was about entering the chateau, Bragelonne met De  Guiche. But before having been met by Raoul, De Guiche had met Manicamp,  who had met Malicorne. How was it that Malicorne had met Manicamp?  Nothing more simple, for he had awaited his return from mass, where he  had accompanied M. de Saint-Aignan. When they met, they congratulated  each other upon their good fortune, and Manicamp availed himself of  the circumstance to ask his friend if he had not a few crowns still  remaining at the bottom of his pocket. The latter, without expressing  any surprise at the question, which he perhaps expected, answered that  every pocket which is always being drawn upon without anything ever  being put in it, resembles those wells which supply water during the  winter, but which gardeners render useless by exhausting during the  summer; that his, Malicorne’s, pocket certainly was deep, and that  there would be a pleasure in drawing on it in times of plenty, but that,  unhappily, abuse had produced barrenness. To this remark, Manicamp, deep  in thought, had replied, “Quite true!”    “The question, then, is how to fill it?” Malicorne added.    “Of course; but in what way?”    “Nothing easier, my dear Monsieur Manicamp.”    “So much the better. How?”    “A post in Monsieur’s household, and the pocket is full again.”    “You have the post?”    “That is, I have the promise of being nominated.”    “Well!”    “Yes; but the promise of nomination, without the post itself, is like a  purse with no money in it.”    “Quite true,” Manicamp replied a second time.    “Let us try for the post, then,” the candidate had persisted.    “My dear fellow,” sighed Manicamp, “an appointment in his royal  highness’s household is one of the gravest difficulties of our  position.”    “Oh! oh!”    “There is no question that, at the present moment, we cannot ask  Monsieur for anything.”    “Why so?” “Because we are not on good terms with him.”
