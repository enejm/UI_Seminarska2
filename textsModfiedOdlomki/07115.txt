Chapter 20      It was still dark when the Hon. Morison Baynes set forth for the  trysting place.  He insisted upon having a guide, saying that he was  not sure that he could find his way back to the little clearing.  As a  matter of fact the thought of that lonely ride through the darkness  before the sun rose had been too much for his courage, and he craved  company.  A black, therefore, preceded him on foot.  Behind and above  him came Korak, whom the noise in the camp had awakened.    It was nine o'clock before Baynes drew rein in the clearing.  Meriem  had not yet arrived.  The black lay down to rest.  Baynes lolled in his  saddle.  Korak stretched himself comfortably upon a lofty limb, where  he could watch those beneath him without being seen.    An hour passed.  Baynes gave evidence of nervousness.  Korak had  already guessed that the young Englishman had come here to meet  another, nor was he at all in doubt as to the identity of that other.  The Killer was perfectly satisfied that he was soon again to see the  nimble she who had so forcefully reminded him of Meriem.    Presently the sound of an approaching horse came to Korak's ears.  She  was coming!  She had almost reached the clearing before Baynes became  aware of her presence, and then as he looked up, the foliage parted to  the head and shoulders of her mount and Meriem rode into view.  Baynes  spurred to meet her.  Korak looked searchingly down upon her, mentally  anathematizing the broad-brimmed hat that hid her features from his  eyes.  She was abreast the Englishman now.  Korak saw the man take both  her hands and draw her close to his breast.  He saw the man's face  concealed for a moment beneath the same broad brim that hid the girl's.  He could imagine their lips meeting, and a twinge of sorrow and sweet  recollection combined to close his eyes for an instant in that  involuntary muscular act with which we attempt to shut out from the  mind's eye harrowing reflections.
