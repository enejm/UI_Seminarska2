"It was not mice," Zahooli gulps. "It is either a hydroradium plant  backfired or a good old-fashioned earthquake."    After a while we have the viso-screen working. The face of Coordinator  Five appears. He says the worst earthquake in five centuries has  happened. There is a crack in the real estate of Department X6 near the  Rockies that makes the Grand Canyon look like a kid just scraped a stick  through some mud. Infra-Red Cross units, he says, are rocketing to the  area.    "There might be somethin' goin' on inside this earth," I says. "If you  don't poke a hole in a baked potato its busts right open from heat  generated inside. Our project, D'Ambrosia, seems even more expedient  than ever."    "That is a new word for 'insane' I must look up," Zahooli says.    Professor Apsox Zalpha comes out with a statement the next morning. He  says the quake confirms his theory that the inside of the Earth is as  hot as a Venutian calypso number, and that gases are being generated by  the heat and that we haven't volcanoes enough on the surface to allow  them to escape.    Exmud R. Zmorro comes and asks me if I have an opinion.    "Ha," I laugh. "I have many on file in the Neuropsychiatorium. Just go  and take your pick. However, I will give you one ad lib and sub rosa.  There is more downstairs than Professor Zalpha dreams about. Who is he  to say there is no civilization in inner space as well as outer? How do  we know that there is not a globe inside a globe with some kind of space  or atmosphere in between?"    Exmud R. Zmorro says thanks and leaves in quite a hurry. I snap off the  gadget and head for my rocket jeep, and fifteen seconds later I am  walking into the factory where a hundred citizens are already at work on  the inner spaceship. It is listing a little to port from the quake but  the head mech says it will be all straightened out in a few hours. It  is just a skeleton ship at the moment with the auger already in place
