the Colonel.    'See how wise is the boy.  He would go back to the Road again, as I  said.  Not knowing yet thy trade--'    'I am not at all sure of that,' the Colonel muttered.    'He turns to me to make a peace between you.  Is he not wise?  He says  he will return.  He is but perfecting his knowledge.  Think, Sahib!  He  has been three months at the school.  And he is not mouthed to that  bit.  For my part, I rejoice.  The pony learns the game.'    'Ay, but another time he must not go alone.'    'Why?  He went alone before he came under the Colonel Sahib's  protection.  When he comes to the Great Game he must go alone--alone,  and at peril of his head.  Then, if he spits, or sneezes, or sits down  other than as the people do whom he watches, he may be slain.  Why  hinder him now?  Remember how the Persians say:  The jackal that lives  in the wilds of Mazanderan can only be caught by the hounds of  Mazanderan.'    'True.  It is true, Mahbub Ali.  And if he comes to no harm, I do not  desire anything better.  But it is great insolence on his part.'    'He does not tell me, even, whither he goes,' said Mahbub.  'He is no  fool.  When his time is accomplished he will come to me.  It is time  the healer of pearls took him in hand.  He ripens too quickly--as  Sahibs reckon.'    This prophecy was fulfilled to the letter a month later.  Mahbub had  gone down to Umballa to bring up a fresh consignment of horses, and Kim  met him on the Kalka road at dusk riding alone, begged an alms of him,  was sworn at, and replied in English.  There was nobody within earshot  to hear Mahbub's gasp of amazement.    'Oho!  And where hast thou been?'    'Up and down--down and up.'    'Come under a tree, out of the wet, and tell.'
