 Agrodyte Hitler, however, has some moxey left in him as he has two of  his hands around Wurpz's throat, the third around Zahooli's leg and is  reaching for a ray Betsy with his fourth. He grabs the disintegrator  just as I belt him over his ugly noggin with a wrench about two feet  long and which was certainly not made of aluminum or balsa wood.    "Himmel!" the Neofeuhrer gulps. "Ach du lebensraum!" He has to be hit  once more which is enough and we tie him up with rope that looks like it  was made out of plutonium filaments.    "Well," I says. "We have a sub from Subterro. Wurpz, you just sit there  at the controls and make sure that needle on the big dial don't move as  I am sure this creep has it on robot so that this tub will automatically  follow the course of the river."    "We are sure takin' a powder," D'Ambrosia yelps. "Look at the monitor!"    We see fish gaping at us from the screen that even Earth citizens with  delirium tremens never saw, and I look quite anxiously at the instrument  panel.    "A thousand miles per and we are climbin'," I says. "I am glad this  Hitler used old Germanic on his subs, and that I majored in it once.  I--er--I am gettin' arthritis all at once! The bends! Uh--er--look, peel  them suits off the other creeps and fast, Zahooli, as I bet they can be  inflated and made into compression chambers. They have got connections  that plug into something."    We pull on the suits which were too big for the beetleheads and for a  good reason. More bends than there are in the Ohio River are with us  before we plug into the right socket. The suits bulge out until our feet  almost leave the floor. I grin through my helmet at Wurpz.    The sub keeps purring and purring. The altimeter registers four thousand  feet. It is a caution, an altimeter in a sub. Two hours later we shoot  out through a hole deep under the coast of Brazil and I know we are in  the ocean as the monitor shows some old wrecked ships about three miles
