We walked into a large room, pleasantly furnished. On a couch opposite  the doorway three men sat talking. Two others stood before them. The  moment we entered, the conversation stopped abruptly.

"That's my father," Beth said after he and I had shaken hands and he had  left. "Demands exactness. He's a scientist, you know. A physicist."    "Oh?" I said. As if I hadn't known. "Is he always this busy?"    "Busier. If he isn't working at the lab till all hours, he's working at  home in his study. Or having conferences. The only time I have him alone
