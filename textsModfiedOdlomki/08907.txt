to kill you before we get the cattle, they may have trekked too far for  us to follow. And if you try to run away we shall easily catch you white  men!”    This struck me as a very odd speech, for the Zulus generally attack an  enemy first and take his cattle afterwards; still, there was a certain  amount of plausibility about it. While I was still wondering what it  all might mean, the Zulus began to run past us in companies towards the  river. Suddenly a shout announced that they had found the spoor of the  cattle, and the whole Impi of them started down it at a run till they  vanished over a rise about a quarter of a mile away.    We waited for half an hour or more, but nothing could we see of them.    “Now I wonder if the devils have really gone,” said Hans Botha to me.  “It is very strange.”    “I will go and see,” said Indaba-zimbi, “if you will come with me,  Macumazahn.
