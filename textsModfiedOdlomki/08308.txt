 command. Otherwise we are all on an equal footing."    "Just so," Lourenço agreed. "If it were otherwise you would still be  three men--not five. Since that is plain, let me say frankly that your  big canoe had best stay here, also everything you do not need in the  bush. Two light canoes are faster, easier to handle and to hide. Pedro  and I have our own canoe and will provide our own supplies. We will pick  out a three-man boat for you and load it with what you select from your  equipment.
