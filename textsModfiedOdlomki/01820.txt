made of the gesture a rite, he placed the chain about the neck of  Princess Marahna--Queen, now, of the People of the Moon. And he knew  that he gave into her keeping their only relic of a being from the  sun. It marked her beyond all future question with a symbol of  mastery. And it made of him a god.    And even a queen may not aspire to such an one.    It was well that Winslow's hand was there to guide him as he walked  with unseeing eyes toward the ship.    *       *       *       *       *    Time may lose at times all meaning and measure--moments become  timeless. It seemed ages to Jerry Foster when Winslow spoke in casual  tones. "I'm going straight up," he said, above the generator's roar.  "Then we'll swing around above the other side. We'll follow the  sun--make the full circle of the moon before we start."    But Jerry neither thought nor heard. His eyes were close to a window  of thick glass. Below him was a shrinking, dwindling landscape,  wind-swept and desolate.    There was a multitude of faces, turned worshipping toward the sky. On  one, who stood apart in tiny loneliness, his vision centered. He  watched and strained his aching eyes until the figure was no more.  Only the pale rose of a dying sun, and a torn, volcanic waste that  tugged strangely at his heart.    "Yes," he answered mechanically, "yes, we'll go round with the sun ...  a couple of sun gods."    He laughed strangely as he regarded his companion.    If Winslow wondered at the weariness in the voice he made no sign. He  was busy with a rheostat that made thunderous roaring of the blast  behind their ship: that swung them in a sweeping arc through velvet  skies, away from the far side of the moon, to follow the path of the  setting sun--homeward bound.          _The Readers' Corner_
