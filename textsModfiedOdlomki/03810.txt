 pile in one and three tubes! Then when we have gone about five hundred  miles, give us the radium push."    Whir-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-o-o-om! The Mole shudders like a citizen looking  at his income tax bite and then starts boring. There is a big bright  light all around us, changing color every second, then there is a sound  like all the pneumatomic drills in all the universe is biting through a  thousand four-inch layers of titanium plate. And with it is a rumble of  thunder from all the electric storms since the snake bit Cleopatra. In  less than five seconds we turn on the oxygen just in case, and I jump to  the instrument panel and look at the arrow on a dial.    "Hey," I yell, "we are makin' a thousand miles per hour through the  ground!"    "Don't look through the ports," Wurpz says.
