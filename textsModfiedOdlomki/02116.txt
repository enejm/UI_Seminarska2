 ship behind an ultra-violet absorbing wall and so became invisible."    "If the walls absorbed all the ultra-violet and were impermeable to  light without ultra-violet, the ship would appear as a black opaque  substance and could be seen."    "That would be true except for one thing which you are forgetting. The  heaviside layer, as I have repeatedly proved, is a splendid conductor of  ultra-violet. The rays falling on it are probably bent along the line of  the covering layer so that they open up and bend around the ship in the  same manner as flowing water will open up and flow around a stone and  then come together again. The light must flow around the solid ship and  then join again in such a manner that the eye can detect no  interruption."    "Jim, all that sounds reasonable, but have you any proof of it?"    "No, First Mortgage, I haven't--yet; but if the Lord is good to us we'll  have definite proof this afternoon and be in a position to successfully  combat this new menace to the world."    "Do you expect me to go on another one of your crack-brained expeditions  into the unknown with you?"    *       *       *       *       *    "Certainly I do, but this time we won't go out of the known. I have our  old space flyer which we took beyond the heaviside layer six years ago  ready for action and we're going to look for the invaders this  afternoon."    "How will we see them if they are invisible?"    "They are invisible to ordinary light but not to ultra-violet light.  While most of the ultra-violet is deflected and flows around the ship or  else is absorbed, I have an idea that, if we bathe it in a sufficient  concentration of ultra-violet, some would be reflected. We are going to  look for the reflected portion."    "Ultra-violet light is invisible."    "It is to the eye, but it can be detected. You know that radium is
