And each knew what the other was seeing--a viscous ocherous mass that  formed into a head where eyes devilish in their hate stared coldly into  theirs....

"And my guess is that is all you would accomplish," Thurston told him.  "I am forming a few theories about our visitors. One is that it would be  quite impossible to find a vital spot in that big homogeneous mass."    The pilot dispensed with theories: his was a more literal mind.
