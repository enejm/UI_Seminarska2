morning, at breakfast, "and find out what Ali Kano is doing--the lazy  beggar should have reported."    "Any news from the N'gombi?" asked Hamilton.    "Only roundabout stories of their industry. Apparently the sugar  merchant is making big experiments. He has set half the people digging  roots for him. Be ready to sail at dawn."    "Will it be a dangerous trip?" asked the girl.    "No. Why?" smiled Sanders.    "Because I'd like to go. Oh, please, don't look so glum! Bones is  awfully good to me."    "Better than a jolly old brother," murmured Bones.    "H'm!" Sanders shook his head, and she appealed to her brother.    "Please!"    "I wouldn't mind your going," said Hamilton, "if only to look after  Bones."    "S-sh!" said Bones reproachfully.    "If you're keen on it, I don't see why you shouldn't--if you had a  chaperon."    "A chaperon!" sneered Bones. "Great Heavens! Do, old skipper, pull  yourself together. Open the jolly old window and give him air. Feelin'  better, sir?"    "A chaperon! How absurd!" cried the girl indignantly. "I'm old enough to  be Bones's mother! I'm nearly twenty--well, I'm older than Bones, and  I'm ever so much more capable of looking after myself."    The end of it was that she went, with her Kano maid and with the wife of  Abiboo to cook for her. And in two days they came to the bend of the  river, and Bones pursued his inquiries for the missing spy, but without  success.    "But this I tell you, lord," said the little chief who acted as  Sanders's agent, "that there are strange things happening in the N'gombi  country, for all the people have gone mad, and are digging up their  teeth (tusks) and bringing them to a white man."    "This shall go to Sandi," said Bones, realizing the importance of the  news; and that same evening he turned the bow of the _Zaire_ down  stream.    *       *       *       *       *
