   "An' he was no fool dog neither," Henry added.    And so was recorded the second epitaph in two days.    A gloomy breakfast was eaten, and the four remaining dogs were harnessed  to the sled.  The day was a repetition of the days that had gone before.  The men toiled without speech across the face of the frozen world.  The  silence was unbroken save by the cries of their pursuers, that, unseen,  hung upon their rear.
