  "Oh, oh," sobbed Mater. "He's lost. He's swum into the abyss and been  eaten by a sea monster." Her slender stem rippled and swayed on its  base and her delicate crown of pinkish tentacles trailed disheveled in  the pull of the ebbtide.    "Pish, my dear!" said Pater. "There are no sea monsters. At worst," he  consoled her stoutly, "Junior may have been trapped in a tidepool."    "Oh, oh," gulped Mater. "He'll be eaten by a land monster."    "There ARE no land monsters!" snorted Pater. He straightened his stalk  so abruptly that the stone to which he and Mater were conjugally  attached creaked under them. "How often must I assure you, my dear,  that WE are the highest form of life?" (And, as for his world and  geologic epoch, he was quite right.)    "Oh, oh," gasped Mater.    Her spouse gave her up. "JUNIOR!" he roared in a voice that loosened  the coral along the reef.    *       *       *       *       *    Round about, the couple's bereavement had begun attracting attention.  In the thickening dusk, tentacles paused from winnowing the sea for  their owners' suppers, stalked heads turned curiously here and there in  the colony. Not far away, a threesome of maiden aunts, rooted en brosse  to a single substantial boulder, twittered condolences and watched  Mater avidly.    "Discipline!" growled Pater. "That's what he needs! Just wait till I--"    "Now, dear--" began Mater shakily.    "Hi, folks!" piped Junior from overhead.    His parents swiveled as if on a single stalk. Their offspring was  floating a few fathoms above them, paddling lazily against the ebb;  plainly he had just swum from some crevice in the reef nearby. In one  pair of dangling tentacles he absently hugged a roundish stone, worn  sensuously smooth by pounding surf.    "WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?"    "Nowhere," said Junior innocently. "Just playing hide-and-go-sink with  the squids."    "With the other polyps," Mater corrected him primly. She detested slang.
