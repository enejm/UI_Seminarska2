than any other city except Paris. Latch on to somebody else. Or if you  want, I can give you a phone number--"    "You don't understand," said Fraser "I want you to investigate this; I  want to know why she did it."    Martinez squinted through a haze of smoke. "Snyder's a rich and powerful  man," he said. "Isn't that enough?"    "No," said Fraser, too tired to be angry at the hint. "Judy isn't that  kind of a girl. Neither is she the kind to go overboard in a few days,  especially when I was there. Sure, that sounds conceited, but dammit, I  _know_ she cared for me."    "Okay. You suspect pressure was brought to bear?"    "Yeah. It's hard to imagine what. I called up Judy's family in Maine,  and they said they were all right, no worries.

"And the era of the gold-digger is pretty well gone--" Fraser sat  staring out the window. It didn't seem right that the sky should be so  full of sunshine.    "Well," said Martinez, "you don't need me. You need a psychologist."    _Psychologist!_    "By God, Juan, I'm going to give you a job anyway!" Fraser leaped to his
