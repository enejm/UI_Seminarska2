  "There's water here, but we must have food," he said. "Friday, you go  back and find fruit; some isuan weed, too, if it's growing nearby. A  chew of it will stimulate us. Keep your ray-gun ready. I wouldn't be  here if I'd not had mine."    The isuan was a big help. In its prepared form it is degrading,  mind-destroying, but in natural state it gives a powerful and  comparatively harmless stimulation. Chewing on the leaves that the  Negro brought back, they made strength and renewed vitality for their  bodies, and came, for the first time since they had started their  flight through space, to a near-normal state. Meaty, yellow globules  of pear-like fruit, followed by prudent drafts of water, aided also.  Friday's long-absent grin returned as he bit into the juicy fruit, and  he announced through a mouthful:    "Well, things're lookin' sunny again! We've got food and water inside  us; we can reach Master Leithgow's laboratory in these here suits; an'  to top it all we've finished high an' mighty Ku Sui. He's dead at  last! Boy, it sure feels good to know it!"    Eliot Leithgow was lying back, breathing deeply of the fresh morning  air. His lined, worn face and body were relaxed. "Yes," he murmured,  "it is good to know that Dr. Ku is now just a thing of the past. He  and his coordinated brains." He glanced aside at the Hawk, sitting  silent and still, and stroking, as always when in meditation, the  bangs of flaxen hair which obscured his forehead. "Why so serious,  Carse?" he asked.    *       *       *       *       *    The adventurer's gray eyes were cold and sober. No relaxation showed  in them. His hand paused in its slow smoothing movement and he spoke.    "Why I overlooked it before," he said quietly, almost as if to  himself, "I don't know. Probably because I was too tired, and too  busy, and too sick to think. But now I see."
