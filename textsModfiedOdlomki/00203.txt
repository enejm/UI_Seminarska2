But he paid no attention to her warning. He reached the edge of the tall  roof, stepped one foot out into the air, and walked into space as calmly  as if he were on firm ground.    The girl, greatly astonished, ran to lean over the edge of the roof, and  saw the man walking rapidly through the air toward the ground.
