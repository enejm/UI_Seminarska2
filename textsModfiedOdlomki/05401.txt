connotation in later years. But on closer inspection, a number of  little things became evident: the steadiness of his light gray eyes;  the marvelously strong-fingered hands; the wiry build of his  splendidly proportioned body. Summing these things up and adding the  brilliant resourcefulness of the man, the complete ignorance of fear,  one could perhaps understand why even his blood enemy, the impassive  Ku Sui, a man otherwise devoid of every human trait, could not face  Carse unmoved in his moments of cold fury.    His name, we know, enters most histories of the period 2117-2148 A.  D., for he has at last been recognized as the one who probably did  most--unofficially, and not with the authority of the Earth  Government--to shape the raw frontiers of space, to push them outward  and to lay the foundations of the present tremendous commerce between  Earth, Vulcan, Pluto, Neptune, Uranus, Saturn and Jupiter. But, little  of his fascinating character may be gleaned from the dry words of  history; and it is Hawk Carse the adventurer, he of the spitting  ray-gun and the phenomenal draw, of the reckless space ship  maneuverings, of the queer bangs of flaxen hair that from a certain  year hid his forehead, of the score of blood feuds and the one great  feud that jarred nations in its final terrible settling--it is with  that man we are concerned here.    A number of his exploits never recorded are still among the favorite  yarns spun by lonely outlanders in the scattered trading posts of the  planets, and among them is that of his final encounter with Judd the  Kite. It shows typically the cold deadliness, the prompt repaying of a  blood debt, the nerveless daring that were the outstanding qualities  of this almost legendary figure.
