could stand it no longer. He got up and dressed, in sheer desperation,  and went for a walk in the gardens.    The day was clear as a new-minted coin. It was not yet wholly aired,  not wholly free from the damp savour of night, but low in the east the  sun was taking heart. A mile-long shadow footed it with Billy Woods  in his pacings through the amber-chequered gardens. Actaeon-like, he  surprised the world at its toilet, and its fleeting grace somewhat  fortified his spirits.    But his thoughts pestered him like gnats. The things he said to the  roses it is not necessary to set down.        XV    After a vituperative half-hour or so Mr. Woods was hungry. He came  back toward Selwoode; and upon the terrace in front of the house he  found Kathleen Saumarez.

It wasn't the same woman:  her thin cheeks flushed arbutus-like, and her rather metallic voice  was grown low and gentle. Billy brought memories with him, you see;  and for the moment, she was Kathleen Eppes again--Kathleen Eppes in  the first flush of youth, eager, trustful, and joyous-hearted, as he  had known her long ago. Since then, the poor woman had eaten of the  bread of dependence and had found it salt enough; she had paid for it
