  "Meriden!" Ray turned to me. "I bet this is a daughter of the major  and his wife!"    "Father was the major," the girl said slowly. "He and mother came in a  machine that flew, from a far land. The Things burned the machine with  the red fire. They came here and the Things kept them. They made  mother sing over the water. They killed father. I never saw him."    "I know," Ray, said gently. "We came from the same land. We saw your  father's machine above."    "You came from outside! And you are going back? Oh, take me with you!  Take me!" Piteous pleading was in her voice. "It is so--lonely since  the Things took Mother away. Mother told me that sometime men would  come, and take me away to see the people and the outside that she told  me of. Oh, please take me!"    "Don't worry! You go along whenever we leave--if we can get out."    "Oh, I am so glad! You are very good!"    Impulsively, she threw her arms around Ray's neck. Gently, he  disengaged himself, flushing a little. I noticed, however, that he did  not seem particularly displeased.    "But can we get out?"    "Mother and I tried. We could never get out. The Things watch. They  make me come to the water to sing, when the great bell rings."    "Are these things goods to eat?" I motioned to the brilliant fungal  forest. I had begun to fear that Ray would never get to this very  important topic.    Blue eyes regarded me. "Eat? Oh, you are hungry! Come! I have food."    *       *       *       *       *    Like a child, she grasped Ray's hand, pulled him toward the mushroom  jungle. I followed, and we slipped in between the brilliantly golden,  fleshy stalks. They rose to the tangle of bright feathery fringes  above, huge and substantial as the trunks of trees.
