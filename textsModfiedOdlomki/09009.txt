remained for about twenty-four hours.  This was not wonderful,  seeing that for two days and nights practically I had not rested,  during which time I went through much fatigue and many emotions.    When at length I did wake up, the first thing I saw was Anscombe  already dressed, engaged in cleaning my clothes with a brush from  his toilet case.  I remember thinking how smart and incongruous  that dressing-bag, made appropriately enough of crocodile hide,  looked in this Kaffir hut with its silver-topped bottles and its  ivory-handled razors.    "Time to get up, Sir.  Bath ready, Sir," he said in his jolly,  drawling voice, pointing to a calabash full of hot water.  "Hope  you slept as well as I did, Sir."    "You appear to have recovered your spirits," I remarked as I rose  and began to wash myself.    "Yes, Sir, and why not?  Heda is quite well, for I have seen her.  These Swazis are very good people, and as Kaatje understands  their language, bring us all we want.  Our troubles seem to be  done with.  Old Marnham is dead, and doubtless cremated; Rodd is  dead and, let us hope, in heaven; the Basutos have melted away,  the morning is fine and warm and a whole kid is cooking for  breakfast."    "I wish there were two, for I am ravenous," I remarked.    "The horses are getting rested and feeding well, though some of  their legs have filled, and the trap is little the worse, for I  have walked to look at them, or rather hopped, leaning on the  shoulder of a very sniffy Swazi boy.  Do you know, old fellow, I  believe there never were any Basutos; also that the venerable  Marnham and the lurid Rodd had no real existence, that they were  but illusions, a prolonged nightmare--no more.  Here is your  shirt.  I am sorry that I have not had time to wash it, but it  has cooked well in the sun, which, being flannel, is almost as  good."    "At any rate Heda remains," I remarked, cutting his nonsense  short, "and I suppose she is not a nightmare or a delusion."
