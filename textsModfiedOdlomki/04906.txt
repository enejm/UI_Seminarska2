"You addressed that to me the second time, Mr. Denham."    There was a look of haggard anxiety about Denham that gave color to her  suspicions. He felt that it was now or never.    "Then why don't you answer it, Miss Gale?" he said gruffly.    She backed away from him.    "Answer it?" she repeated faintly.    "Certainly. If I got a letter twice, I would answer it."    "What do you mean?" she cried, with her hand on the door-knob.    "Exactly what the letter says. I want you for my partner.

Why did you  put me to all that worry writing that idiotic letter, when a few words  would have saved ever so much bother? You evidently _need_ a  partner. My mother will be pleased to meet you any time you call. You  have the address,--Your friend,
