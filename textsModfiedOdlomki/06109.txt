for next on Joan's agenda for Braun was an entry into politics as a  fighting liberal--a New Dealer twenty years too late. Since I'm mildly  liberal myself when I'm off duty, I hated to think what Braun's career  might tell me about my own motives, if I'd let it.    *       *       *       *       *    All of which had nothing to do with why I was prowling around the  _Ludmilla_--or did it? I kept remembering Anderton's challenge: "You  can't take such a gamble. There are eight and a half million lives  riding on it--" That put it up into Braun's normal operating area, all  right. The connection was still hazy, but on the grounds that any link  might be useful, I phoned him.    He remembered me instantly; like most uneducated, power-driven men, he  had a memory as good as any machine's.    "You never did send me that paper you was going to write," he said. His  voice seemed absolutely unchanged, although he was in his seventies now.  "You promised you would."    "Kids don't keep their promises as well as they should," I said. "But  I've still got copies and I'll see to it that you get one, this time.  Right now I need another favor--something right up your alley."    "CIA business?"    "Yes. I didn't know you knew I was with CIA."    Braun chuckled. "I still know a thing or two," he said. "What's the  angle?"    "That I can't tell you over the phone. But it's the biggest gamble there  ever was, and I think we need an expert. Can you come down to CIA's  central headquarters right away?"    "Yeah, if it's that big. If it ain't, I got lots of business here, Andy.  And I ain't going to be in town long. You're sure it's top stuff?"    "My word on it."    He was silent a moment. Then he said, "Andy, send me your paper."
