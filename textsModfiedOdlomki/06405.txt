  I walked round the lake to look for an outlet.  A fine mountain stream  came in at the north end, and at the south end, sure enough, a  considerable river debauched.  My exploring zeal redoubled, and I  followed its course in a delirium of expectation.  It was a noble  stream, clear as crystal, and very unlike the muddy tropical Labongo at  Umvelos'.  Suddenly, about a quarter of a mile from the lake, the land  seemed to grow over it, and with a swirl and a hollow roar, it  disappeared into a mighty pot-hole.  I walked a few steps on, and from  below my feet came the most uncanny rumbling and groaning. Then I knew  what old Coetzee's devil was that howled in the Rooirand.    Had I continued my walk to the edge of the cliff, I might have learned  a secret which would have stood me in good stead later.  But the  descent began to make me anxious, and I retraced my steps to the top of  the chimney whence I had come.  I was resolved that nothing would make  me descend by that awesome crack, so I kept on eastward along the top  to look for a better way.  I found one about a mile farther on, which,  though far from easy, had no special risks save from the appalling  looseness of the _d√©bris_.  When I got down at length, I found that it  was near sunset.  I went to the place I had bidden my native look for  me at, but, as I had feared, there was no sign of him.  So, making the  best of a bad job, I had supper and a pipe, and spent a very chilly  night in a hole among the boulders.    I got up at dawn stiff and cold, and ate a few raisins for breakfast.  There was no sign of horses, so I resolved to fill up the time in  looking for the fold of the cliff which, as I had seen from the  horrible crack of yesterday, contained a gully.  It was a difficult  job, for to get the sidelong view of the cliff I had to scramble
