face-plates. We must go up--far up--to get our bearings."    Altitude swept back the horizon as they arrowed up through the warm,  glowing air. From far in the heavens, perhaps twenty miles, Carse saw  what he looked for--a bright gleam of silver in the monochrome of the  terrain, where Jupiter's light struck on the smooth metal hides of a  group of space-ships resting in the satellite's lone port, Porno.  Eighty, a hundred miles away--some such distance. Into the helmet's  tiny microphone he said:    "That's Porno, over to the 'north,' and there to one side is the Great  Briney. It's not far: you won't have to hurry, Eliot. Head straight  for the lake and follow the near shoreline toward Porno, and you'll  come to Ban Wilson's ranch. Now we part."    The three clinging, giant forms separated. The direction-rods for  horizontal movement were out-hinged. A last touch of mitten-gloves on  the bloated suits fabric; a nod and a smile through the face-plates;  and a few parting words:    "Good luck, old comrade!"--in Leithgow's soft voice; and the Negro's  deep, emphatic bass: "Don't know how far these little sets work, suh,  but if you need me, call. I'll keep listenin'!"    And then white man and black were speeding away in the ruddy flood of  Jupiter-light, and Hawk Carse faced the danger trail alone, as was his  wont.    *       *       *       *       *    Caution rather than speed had to mark his journey, Carse knew. Several  ranches lay scattered in the jungle smother between him and the  port--stations where the weed isuan was collected and refined into the  deadly finished product. They were worked for the most part by  Venusians allied with Ku Sui: the Eurasian practically controlled the  drug trade; and therefore, if any alarm had been broadcast, many men  would already be on the lookout for him.    So the Hawk dropped low, and chose a course through the screening  walls of the jungle. It did not take him long to attain full mastery
