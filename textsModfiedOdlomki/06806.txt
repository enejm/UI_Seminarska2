 had decided. Seizing his fireman's axe he rushed off down the street.    The result of this was inevitable. He was dismissed with ignominy  from the Special Constables and was condemned to death, with a  recommendation to mercy, by a court-martial of the Kentish Fencibles.  His old friends among the Men of Kent cut him dead; the tradesmen of  his platoon refused to serve him. He had to leave Ramstairs and he  retired to Ealing. The catastrophe ruined his health. But he still  gets a little solace when, as he wipes the tears from his eyes after  reading the correspondence column of his penny paper, he sees upon his  waistcoat the crossed axes surmounted by a fire bucket, the emblem of  the Veterans' Fire Brigade.    *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: _Aunt (guardian of little nephew who has run away)_.
