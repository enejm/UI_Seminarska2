  "Stand by to receive your dog," was Scott's peremptory order to  Cherokee's owner.    The faro-dealer stooped down obediently and got a firm hold on Cherokee.    "Now!" Scott warned, giving the final pry.    The dogs were drawn apart, the bull-dog struggling vigorously.    "Take him away," Scott commanded, and Tim Keenan dragged Cherokee back  into the crowd.    White Fang made several ineffectual efforts to get up.  Once he gained  his feet, but his legs were too weak to sustain him, and he slowly wilted  and sank back into the snow.  His eyes were half closed, and the surface  of them was glassy.  His jaws were apart, and through them the tongue  protruded, draggled and limp.  To all appearances he looked like a dog  that had been strangled to death.  Matt examined him.    "Just about all in," he announced; "but he's breathin' all right."    Beauty Smith had regained his feet and come over to look at White Fang.    "Matt, how much is a good sled-dog worth?" Scott asked.    The dog-musher, still on his knees and stooped over White Fang,  calculated for a moment.    "Three hundred dollars," he answered.    "And how much for one that's all chewed up like this one?" Scott asked,  nudging White Fang with his foot.    "Half of that," was the dog-musher's judgment.  Scott turned upon Beauty  Smith.    "Did you hear, Mr. Beast?  I'm going to take your dog from you, and I'm  going to give you a hundred and fifty for him."    He opened his pocket-book and counted out the bills.    Beauty Smith put his hands behind his back, refusing to touch the  proffered money.    "I ain't a-sellin'," he said.    "Oh, yes you are," the other assured him.  "Because I'm buying.  Here's  your money.  The dog's mine."    Beauty Smith, his hands still behind him, began to back away.    Scott sprang toward him, drawing his fist back to strike.  Beauty Smith  cowered down in anticipation of the blow.
