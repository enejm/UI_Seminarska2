Then, with lighted matches, I found my way to a door at the back of the  building, at the end. I opened it and peered out, to see a retaining  wall and stone steps leading up to ground level. I eased out into the  areaway and pulled the door shut, noticing that I still held the folded  filter-paper with the fragment in it. The lock clicked and I realized  that my bridge was, as they say, burned behind me.    Two cops were talking together a little way to my right, but their  backs were turned and they were looking up. I, too, looked and saw  the whirlpool of debris, which was exactly as Molly had described and  quite as attention-calling. Clutching the filter-paper like a talisman,  I climbed the steps and gumshoed away to the left, but as I got to the  corner, I met a group of young men, also looking up.

I barely had time to duck into a doorway to avoid being  seen. I had the feeling of a member of the I.R.A. in Dublin during the  Troubles, and I crouched against the door.    I could now hear the lieutenant's voice: "Of course he's up there!
