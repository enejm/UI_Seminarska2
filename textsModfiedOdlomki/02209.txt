"Come!" barked one of the guards in Dick's ear.    Dick attempted no further resistance. Convinced of its futility, sick  and reeling from the blows he had received, he accompanied his captors  quietly. There was nothing more that he could do, either for President  Hargreaves or for old Luke, but he still imagined the possibility of  somehow warning the approaching fleet or the occupants of the  dirigible.    He was led along the passage, past the guards, and up the stairs  again. The top door opened upon vacancy; it closed, and vanished.

Von Kettler stepped to a switch attached to a stanchion of white  metal, surmounted by a huge opaque glass dome, and threw it over.  Instantly the hum and whir of machinery became audible, the sound of
