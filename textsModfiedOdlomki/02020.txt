But Kendrick never completed that sentence--for now whistles all over  the metropolitan area, rising from the generating plants, announced  the ominous hour.    It was high noon. The ultimatum had expired.    Lifting tense faces to the disc, they waited. Would that stupendous  ray be hurled back upon itself? Or would it sear through their  makeshift defense, plunging them and the whole great metropolis into  oblivion?    Suddenly, cataclysmically, the answer came.    There burst a withering whirlwind from the disc. It struck that mighty  concave cathode of interlaced waves above the city. There followed an  instant's clash of titanic forces. Then the cathode triumphed, hurled  it back.    Rocked by a concussion as of two worlds in impact, blinded by a glare  that made the sunlight seem feeble in comparison. Marjorie and  Kendrick clung together, while the disc grew into a satellite of  calcium fire in the sky.    Presently, as the conflagration waned, they opened their eyes.  Gravely, but with deep thanksgiving, they searched each other's faces.  In them they read deep understanding, too, and a new hope.    "I think we'd better go and find father," she said at length, quietly.    "I think so too!" he agreed.    As they headed toward the laboratory, a fine, powdery dust, like  volcanic ash was falling.    It continued to fall until the city streets were covered to a depth of  an inch or more.    Thus passed the menace of Vada.
