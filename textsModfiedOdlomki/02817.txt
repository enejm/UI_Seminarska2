  "Never mind." Pater turned to reassure her. "Once Junior is properly  rooted, his self-respect will cause him to keep riffraff at a distance.  It's a matter of Psychology, my dear; the vertical position makes all  the difference in one's thinking."    *       *       *       *       *    The great day arrived. Laboriously Junior put a few finishing  touches to his construction--which, so far as could be seen from a  distance, had turned out decent-looking enough, though it was rather  questionably original in design: lower and flatter than was customary.    With one more look at his handiwork, Junior turned bottom-end-down  and sank wearily onto the finished site. After a minute, he paddled  experimentally, but flailing tentacles failed to lift him.

"I ..." gulped Pater, "I'm afraid not."    At least, they saw, there was method in Junior's actions. He went on  paddling in the same fashion and now he, and his platform with him,  were farther away than they had been, and growing more remote as they  stared.    *       *       *       *       *
