 scientist's weird revelation. "I get you," he said, rather inelegantly  for a professor. "You mean that if every living thing in the world  should pass out, every man, every plant, every animal, even down to  microscopic infusoria, the Mind would collect all its electrons, and  through some more jealous law of, er, cohesion hold these electrons  inviolate from matter and energy?"    "Right! And again, as in the beginning, the Mind would rule supreme. By  what I have proved, you and I and all other creatures that now have life  may, as separate unfleshed electrons, enjoy eternal consciousness as a  part of the Mind."

I merely made available the  materials, or, rather, I made the conditions under which matter was able  to enslave mind-electrons."    He opened the door, slipped his body through, and, with his ugly,  teeth-revealing grin, gestured for Hale to follow him.    Hale steeled himself and looked around half fearfully. The first glance
