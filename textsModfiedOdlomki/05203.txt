and as one their eyes went to the radio loudspeaker. A contact question  was being asked in the usual way:    "Are you there, Judd? Are you there, Judd? Are you there, Judd?"    The voice was not that of Ku Sui. It was a dead voice, toneless,  emotionless, mechanical.    "Are you there, Judd?" it went on, over and over.    "The mike switch, Friday," the Hawk said, and then was at Sako's side,  his ray-gun transfixing the man with its threatening angle. "Play your  part well," was the whisper from his lips.    The switch went over with a click. Trembling, Sako faced the microphone.    "This is Sako," he said.    "Sako?" the dead voice asked. "I want Judd. Where is Judd?"    "Judd is dead. The trap failed, and there was a fight on Iapetus. Judd  was killed by Carse, and most of the others. Only two of us are left,  but we have Carse and the negro, prisoners, alive. What are your  instructions?"    A half minute went by, and the three men hardly breathed.    "How do we know you are Sako?" said the voice at last. "Give the  recognition."    "The insignia of Dr. Ku Sui?"    "Yes. It is----"    Carse's ray-gun prodded the stomach of the sweating Sako.    "An asteroid," he said hastily, "in the center of a circle of the ten  planets."    The unseen speaker was quiet. Evidently he was conferring with someone  else, probably Ku Sui.    "All right," his toneless voice came back at last. "You will remain  motionless in your present position, keeping your radio receiver open  for further instructions. We are approaching and will be with you in  thirty minutes."    Carse motioned to Friday to switch off the mike. Sako sank limply into a  chair, soaked with perspiration.    "Now we must wait again," the Hawk murmured, crossing his arms and  scanning the visi-screen.    *      *      *      *      *
