  _I had to stay_, he thought. _This is my land, I am of it and I couldn't  go. Someone had to stay and keep the land, if only for a little while. I  can give it ten more years before the forest comes and takes it._    Darkness grew around him. The woods beyond the hill loomed like a wall.  Once he started violently, he thought he heard a child crying. No, only  a bird. He cursed himself for the senseless pounding of his heart.    _Gloomy place here_, he thought. _Better get back to the house._    He groped slowly out of the yard, toward the road. The stars were out  now. Kormt looked up and thought he had never seen them so bright. Too  bright; he didn't like it.    _Go away, stars_, he thought. _You took my people, but I'm staying here.  This is my land._ He reached down to touch it, but the grass was cold  and wet under his palm.    The gravel scrunched loudly as he walked, and the wind mumbled in the  hedges, but there was no other sound. Not a voice called; not an engine  turned; not a dog barked. No, he hadn't thought it would be so quiet.    And dark. No lights. Have to tend the street lamps himself--it was no  fun, not being able to see the town from here, not being able to see  anything except the stars. Should have remembered to bring a flashlight,  but he was old and absentminded, and there was no one to remind him.  When he died, there would be no one to hold his hands; no one to close  his eyes and lay him in the earth--and the forests would grow in over  the land and wild beasts would nuzzle his bones.    _But I knew that. What of it? I'm tough enough to take it._    The stars flashed and flashed above him. Looking up, against his own  will, Kormt saw how bright they were, how bright and quiet. And how very  far away! He was seeing light that had left its home before he was born.    He stopped, sucking in his breath between his teeth. "No," he whispered.
