   "It will, some day. Look how long it took to read Egyptian  hieroglyphics, even after they had the Rosetta Stone."    Sachiko smiled. "Yes. I know. But they did have the Rosetta Stone."    "And we don't. There is no Rosetta Stone, not anywhere on Mars. A whole  race, a whole species, died while the first Cr√≤-Magnon cave-artist was  daubing pictures of reindeer and bison, and across fifty thousand years  and fifty million miles there was no bridge of understanding.    "We'll find one. There must be something, somewhere, that will give us  the meaning of a few words, and we'll use them to pry meaning out of  more words, and so on. We may not live to learn this language, but we'll  make a start, and some day somebody will."    Sachiko took her hands from her eyes, being careful not to look toward  the unshaded light, and smiled again. This time Martha was sure that it  was not the Japanese smile of politeness, but the universally human  smile of friendship.    "I hope so, Martha: really I do. It would be wonderful for you to be the  first to do it, and it would be wonderful for all of us to be able to  read what these people wrote. It would really bring this dead city to  life again." The smile faded slowly. "But it seems so hopeless."    "You haven't found any more pictures?"    Sachiko shook her head. Not that it would have meant much if she had.  They had found hundreds of pictures with captions; they had never been  able to establish a positive relationship between any pictured object  and any printed word. Neither of them said anything more, and after a  moment Sachiko replaced the loup and bent her head forward over the  book.    *       *       *       *       *    Selim von Ohlmhorst looked up from his notebook, taking his pipe out of  his mouth.    "Everything finished, over there?" he asked, releasing a puff of smoke.
