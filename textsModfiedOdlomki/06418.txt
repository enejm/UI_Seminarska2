placidly at the spot where Henriques had slain the Keeper and I had  stolen the rubies. There was no interest or imagination lingering in my  dull brain.  My nerves had suddenly become things of stolid, untempered  iron.  Each landmark I passed was noted down as one step nearer to my  object.  At Umvelos' I had not the leisure to do more than glance at  the shell which I had built.  I think I had forgotten all about that  night when I lay in the cellar and heard Laputa's plans.  Indeed, my  doings of the past days were all hazy and trivial in my mind.  I only  saw one sight clearly--two men, one tall and black, the other little  and sallow, slowly creeping nearer to the Rooirand, and myself, a  midget on a horse, spurring far behind through the bush on their trail.

I must have passed east of Arcoll's  men, who were driving the bush towards Majinje's.  I had ridden the
