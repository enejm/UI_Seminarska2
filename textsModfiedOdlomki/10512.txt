 "Yes, yes," said Bones.  "Go on."    "In fact, I wonder that Mr. de Vinne bothered about him."    "De Vinne?" said Bones sitting up.  "Harold de Vinne, the moneyed one?"    "That's him.  He's one of our oldest customers," said Hilton.    "Indeed," said Bones, this time without any enthusiasm at all.    "You see, a man did him in the eye," explained Mr. Hilton, "swindled  him, and all that sort of thing.  Well, I think we have got enough to  make this chap look silly."    "Oh, yes," said Bones politely.  "What have you got?"    "Well, it appears," said Hilton, "that this chap is madly in love with  his typist."    "Which chap?" said Bones.    "The fellow who did Mr. de Vinne in the eye," replied the patient Mr.  Hilton.  "He used to be an officer on the West Coast of Africa, and was  known as Bones.  His real name is Tibbetts."    "Oh yes," said Bones.    "Well, we've found out all about him," continued Hilton.  "He's got a  flat in Jermyn Street, and this girl of his, this typist girl, dines  with him.  She's not a bad-looking girl, mind you."    Bones rose to his feet, and there was in his face a terrible look.    "Hilton," he said, "do you mean that you have been shadowing a  perfectly innocent man and a charming, lovely old typewriter, that  couldn't say 'Goo' to a boose?"    Bones was pardonably agitated.    "Do you mean to tell me that this office descends to this low practice  of prying into the private lives of virtuous gentlemen and typewriters?  Shame upon you, Hilton!"  His voice shook.  "Give me that report!"  He  thrust the report into the fire.  "Now call up Mr. Borker, and tell him  I want to see him on business, and don't disturb me, because I am  writing a letter."    He pulled a sheet of paper from his stationery rack and wrote  furiously.  He hardly stopped to think, he scarcely stopped to spell.
