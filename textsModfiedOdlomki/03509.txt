  Small wonder the northmen feared them. Cappen threw back his head and  laughed. He had once done a service for a mighty wizard in the south,  and his reward hung about his neck, a small silver amulet. The wizard  had told him that no supernatural being could harm anyone who carried a  piece of silver.    The northmen said that a troll was powerless against a man who was not  afraid; but, of course, only to see one was to feel the heart turn to  ice. They did not know the value of silver, it seemed--odd that they  shouldn't, but they did not.
