Somehow, while  he talked to her and rested those cold eyes upon her, she was under the  spell of the great scientist. Her son, before the trouble into which he  had been dragged by the professor, had often hinted at the abilities of  Ramsey Burr, given her the idea that his employer was practically a  necromancer, yet a magician whose advanced scientific knowledge was  correct and explainable in the light of reason.    Yes, Allen had talked to her often when he was at home, resting from his  labors with Professor Burr. He had spoken of the new electricity  discovered by the famous man, and also told his mother that Burr had  found a method of separating atoms and then transforming them into a  form of radio-electricity so that they could be sent in radio waves, to  designated points. And she now remembered--the swift trial and  conviction of Allen on the charge of murder had occupied her so deeply  that she had forgotten all else for the time being--that her son had  informed her quite seriously that Professor Ramsey Burr would soon be  able to transport human beings by radio.    "Neither of us will be injured in any way by the change," said Burr  calmly. "It is possible for me now to break up human flesh, send the  atoms by radio-electricity, and reassemble them in their proper form by  these special transformers and atom filters."    Mrs. Baker took all the apparatus presented her by the professor. She  ventured the thought that it might be better to perform the experiment  at once, instead of waiting until the last minute, but this Professor  Burr waved aside as impossible. He needed the extra time, he said, and  there was no hurry.    She glanced about the room, and her eye took in the giant switches of
