  Or had Miko rejoined his party, left his camp and come here like  ourselves to climb Archimedes? Or was our assumption wholly  wrong--perhaps the brigand ship would not land near here at all?    Sweeping around from the Mare Imbrium, the plains were less  smooth--the shattered, crag-littered, crater-scarred region beyond  which the distant Apennines raised their terraced walls. The little  crater which concealed the Grantline camp was off that way. There was  nothing to mark it from here.    "Gregg, do you see anything up there? There seems to be a blur."    *       *       *       *       *    Her sight, sharper than mine, had picked it out. The descending  brigand ship! A faintest tiny blur against the stars, a few of them  occulted as though strangely an invisible shadow were upon them. A  growing shadow, materializing into a blur--a blob, a shape faintly  defined. Then sharper until we were sure of what we saw. It was the  brigand ship. It came dropping slowly, silently down.    We crouched on the little ledge. A cave-mouth was behind us. A gully  was beside us, a break in the ledge; and at our feet the wall dropped  sheer.    We had extinguished our little lights. We crouched, silently gazing up  into the stars.    The ship, when first we distinguished it was central over Archimedes.  We thought for a while that it might descend into the crater. But it  did not; it came sailing forward.    I whispered into the audiphone--whispering by instinct, as though out  here in all this airless desolation someone might overhear us!    "It's coming over the crater."    Her hand pressed my arm in answer.    I recalled that when, from the _Planetara_, Miko had forced Snap to  signal this brigand band on Mars, Miko's only information as to the  whereabouts of the Grantline camp was that it lay between Archimedes  and the Apennines. That was Grantline's first message to us, and Miko
