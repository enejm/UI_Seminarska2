got involved in a rough game of basketball in the living room.    "BING!" said the timer.    Bob dropped the basketball on Bonnie's head and ran back into the  kitchen.    "It's all done," he said, and took the cover off the pot. Only his  dedication to his work kept him from showing the discomfort he felt  with the smell that the pot gave forth.    "Fyew!" said Bonnie. "What do we do with it now? Throw it out?"    "No, stupid. We have to stir it till it cools and then drink it."    "Drink it?" Bonnie wrinkled her nose. "How come we have to drink it?"    Bobby said, "Because that's what you do with experiments, stupid."    "But, Bob, it smells like garbage."    "Medicine smells worse and it makes you healthy," Bob said, while  stirring the pot with an old wooden spoon.    Bonnie held her nose, stood on tiptoe and looked in at the cooking  solution. "Will this make us healthy?"    "Maybe." Bob kept stirring.    "What will it do?"    "You'll see." Bob took two clean dish towels, draped them around the  pot and carried it over to the formica kitchen table. In the process,  he managed to dip both towels in the mixture and burn his already  sliced thumb. One plastic handle of the pot was still smoldering, from  being too near the fire, but none of these things seemed to have the  slightest effect on him. He put the pot down in the middle of the table  and stared at it, chin in hand.    Bonnie plopped down opposite him, put her chin in her hands and asked,  "We _have_ to drink that stuff?"    "Yup."    "Who has to drink it first?" Bob made no sign of having heard. "I  thought so," said Bonnie. Still no comment. "What if it kills me?"    Bobby spoke by raising his whole head and keeping his jaw stationary  in his hands. "How can it hurt you? There's nothing but pure food in  there."    Bonnie also sat and stared. "How much of that stuff do I have to drink?"
