Saxons until long afterward--my last trip but two, in fact. I was  at a school in England....    *       *       *       *       *    The headmistress of St Agatha's prided herself on being fair. Her  way of being fair was to avoid favoritism by being equally unfair to  all the girls and to those of the assistant teachers who would stand  for it. Some of them didn't, and they usually left after their first  term, as the headmistress didn't believe in contracts. Besides, at  the beginning of the twentieth century, contracts for teachers were a  novelty.    The result of this policy was a rapid turnover in the young and  intelligent teachers, and a small permanent staff of compliant sheep.  That St. Agatha's had any scholastic standing was due to the fact that  Miss Wakefield had taken honors at Girton, and the school's social  standing was due to her being the cousin of a Peer of the Realm. The  girls were fed almost enough, the school uniform was expensive, and  nobody had much free time. French was well taught--by Miss Wakefield  herself--and so was Latin, but games were also stressed. The school  was run on what Miss Wakefield called the Honor System, which had the  effect of dividing the pupils into tale-bearers and secret rebels.    On a raw November afternoon, Miss Wakefield sent a prefect for Sarah  Stone, who was one of the new girls. "Tell her to come straight to my  office. She can have her shower later," she said, and Sarah arrived in  the jersey and serge skirt she had been wearing on the hockey field.  Her bare knees were blue and her nose was running. She stood waiting  while the headmistress looked with prominent eyes at some papers on her  desk. Sarah could see that they were examination papers and one of them  was in her own handwriting.    Without looking up, Miss Wakefield said, "I hear that your mother is in  trouble with the police."
