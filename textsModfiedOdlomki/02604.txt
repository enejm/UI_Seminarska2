Two hours later it was when Milton and Randall and Lanier and Nelson  turned to the laboratory's door. They paused to glance behind them. Of  the great matter-transmitter and receiver, of the apparatus that had  crowded the laboratory, there remained now but wreckage.    For that had been their first thought, their first task, when the  astounded Nelson had brought the three back to consciousness and had  heard their amazing tale. They had wrecked so completely the  matter-station and its actuating apparatus that none could ever have  guessed what a mechanism of wonder the laboratory a short time before  had held.    The cubical chambers had been smashed beyond all recognition, the  dynamos were masses of split metal and fused wiring, the batteries of  tubes were shattered, the condensers and transformers and wiring  demolished. And it had only been when the last written plans and  blue-prints of the mechanism had been burned that Milton and Randall  and Lanier had stopped to allow their exhausted bodies a moment of  rest.    *       *       *       *       *    Now as they paused at the laboratory's door, Lanier reached and swung  it open. Together, silent, they gazed out.    It all seemed to Randall exactly as upon the night before. The shadowy  masses in the darkness, the heaving, dim-lit sea stretching far away  before them, the curtain of summer stars stretched across the heavens.

Randall's hand was on his shoulder. "But we closed that gate, too, in  the end."    Milton nodded slowly. "We--or the fate that rules our worlds. But the  gate is closed, and God grant, shall never again be opened by any on
