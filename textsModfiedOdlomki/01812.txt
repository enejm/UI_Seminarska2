were advancing! They saw us, and came running.    "Anita! Look! We've got to get out of here!"    The secondary lock was open to the corridor. We jammed on our helmets.  The unhelmeted brigands by then were fumbling at the inner panel. I  pulled at the lever of the outer panel. The brigands were hurrying,  thinking they could be in time to stop me. One of the more cautious  fumbled with a helmet.    "Anita, run! Try and keep your feet."    I slid the outer panel and pushed at Anita. Simultaneously the  brigands opened the inner porte.
