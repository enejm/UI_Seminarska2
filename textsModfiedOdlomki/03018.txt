 "No!" Matheny scuttled behind a chair. "No, look here! I, Peter Matheny  of the Martian Republic, declare you are blackmailing me!"    "I'm asking compensation for damages," growled Sam. "Hand it over or  I'll go talk to a lawyer. That ain't blackmail. You got your choice,  don't you?"    Matheny wilted. "Yes."    "A megabuck isn't so bad, Pete," soothed Doran. "I personally will see  that you earn it back in--"    "Oh, never mind." Tears stood in Matheny's eyes. "You win." He took out  his checkbook.    "None of that," rapped Sam. "Cash. Now."    "But you claimed this was a legitimate--"    "You heard me."    "Well--could I have a receipt?" begged Matheny.    Sam grinned.    "I just thought I'd ask," said Matheny. He opened a drawer and counted  out one hundred ten-kilo-buck bills. "There! And, and, and I hope you  choke on it!"    Sam stuffed the money in a pocket and lumbered out.    Doran lingered. "Look here, Pete," he said, "I will make this up to  you. Honest. All you have got to do is trust me."    "Sure." Matheny slumped on the bed. "Not your fault. Let me alone for a  while, will you?"    "Listen, I will come back in a few hours and buy you the best dinner in  all the Protectorates and--"    "Sure," said Matheny. "Sure."    Doran left, closing the door with great gentleness.    *       *       *       *       *    He returned at 1730, entered, and stopped dead. The floor space was  half taken up by a screen and a film projector.    "What happened, Pete?" he asked uncertainly.    Matheny smiled. "I took some tourist movies," he said. "Self-developing  soundtrack film. Sit down and I'll show you."    "Well, thanks, but I am not so much for home movies."    "It won't take long. Please."
