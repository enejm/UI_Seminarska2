Lady Aurex led them to a window which faced the side of the great dome  which covered all the village, and they could see that the island was  indeed sinking, for the water of the lake was already half way up the  side of the dome. Through the glass could be seen swimming fishes, and  tall stalks of swaying seaweeds, for the water was clear as crystal and  through it they could distinguish even the farther shore of the lake.    "The Flatheads are not here yet," said Lady Aurex. "They will come  soon, but not until all of this dome is under the surface of the water."    "Won't the dome leak?" Dorothy inquired anxiously.
