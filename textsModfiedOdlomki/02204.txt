  *       *       *       *       *    As soon as Von Kettler had been temporarily established in his new  quarters, a pretty, fair-haired young woman came along the corridor,  conducted by the Superintendent himself. She walked with dignity, her  bearing was proud, she smiled at her brother through the grill, and  there was no trace of weeping about her eyes.    She bowed with pretty formality, and Von Kettler saluted her with an  airy wave of the hand. Then they began to speak, and the German guard  who had been selected for the purpose of interpreting to the  Superintendent afterward, was baffled.    It was not German--neither was it French, Italian, or any of the  Romance languages. As a matter of fact, it was Hungarian.    Not until the half-hour was up did they lapse into English, and all  the while they might have been conversing on art, literature, or  sport. There was no hint of tragedy in this last meeting.    "Good-by, Rudy," smiled his sister, "I'll see you soon."    "To-night or to-morrow," replied Von Kettler indifferently.    The girl blew him a kiss. She seemed to detach it from her mouth and  extend it through the grill with a graceful gesture of the hand, and  Von Kettler caught it with a romantic wave of the fingers and strained  it to his heart. But it was only one of those queer foreign ways.  Nothing was passed. The alert guard, sitting under the electric light,  was sure of that.    They searched Von Kettler again after he was back in the death house.  The other cells were empty. In three of them detectives were placed.  In the yard beyond the hangman was experimenting with the trap. He  himself was under close observation. Nothing was being left to chance.    *       *       *       *       *
