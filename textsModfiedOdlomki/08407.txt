was running. Nor was this all. By the stream, basking in the bright  sun, stood and lay a group of from ten to fifteen _large antelopes_--at  that distance we could not see of what species.    The sight filled us with an unreasoning joy. If only we could get it,  there was food in plenty. But the question was how to do so. The beasts  were fully six hundred yards off, a very long shot, and one not to be  depended on when our lives hung on the results.    Rapidly we discussed the advisability of trying to stalk the game, but  in the end dismissed it reluctantly. To begin with, the wind was not  favourable, and further, we must certainly be perceived, however  careful we were, against the blinding background of snow, which we  should be obliged to traverse.    "Well, we must have a try from where we are," said Sir Henry. "Which  shall it be, Quatermain, the repeating rifles or the expresses?"    Here again was a question. The Winchester repeaters--of which we had  two, Umbopa carrying poor Ventv√∂gel's as well as his own--were sighted  up to a thousand yards, whereas the expresses were only sighted to  three hundred and fifty, beyond which distance shooting with them was  more or less guess-work. On the other hand, if they did hit, the  express bullets, being "expanding," were much more likely to bring the  game down. It was a knotty point, but I made up my mind that we must  risk it and use the expresses.    "Let each of us take the buck opposite to him. Aim well at the point of  the shoulder and high up," said I; "and Umbopa, do you give the word,  so that we may all fire together."    Then came a pause, each of us aiming his level best, as indeed a man is  likely to do when he knows that life itself depends upon the shot.    "Fire," said Umbopa in Zulu, and at almost the same instant the three  rifles rang out loudly; three clouds of smoke hung for a moment before  us, and a hundred echoes went flying over the silent snow. Presently
