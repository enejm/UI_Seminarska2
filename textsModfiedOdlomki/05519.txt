that one wild second of impact, all the asteroid's functioning  mechanism had been destroyed. Lar Tantril had not thought quite far  enough: he had not sealed the buildings air-tight against a possible  crashing of the dome, and for that reason alone he and his men had  gone down in full defeat under the drive of the Hawk.    Shreds of flotsam drifting and turning in space around the dome now  became visible--bits of wreckage hurled out from the tear, and also a  number of white, bloated things which once had been the bodies of men.  The outrushing tide of air had taken them along, and now they drifted,  shapeless, all of a kind, in the lifelessness of space.    "Merciful heaven!" whispered Eliot Leithgow, staring at the  desolation. "Gone! Just snuffed out!"    The Hawk took over again and brought and held the _Sandra_ in a  position a quarter of a mile above the now rapidly falling asteroid.    "They're all dead, I'm sure," he said in a voice hard and emotionless  as his graven face. "They must be, for the asteroid is now visible,  and that means that the doors of the power building were open. Inside  and out, all there is dead, machinery and men.... Still, it had to be  done. It was they or we. A variation of the trick we used to escape  from the dome before, Eliot; and Tantril of course didn't expect it  and protect himself as Ku Sui did that other time. It's all done  now--yes, its gravity-plates too, for see, it's turning."    "And fast!" murmured Friday.    The body was rotating around its longer axis at about twice the speed  of an Earth-watch's second hand. Now the dome was sliding under, out  of their sight, the craggy rock belly coming up to take its place.  Nine hundred miles away was Earth--rather, less than that, for the  body was now free to accept the tremendous gravity pull of the planet  so near. Soon it would plunge to destruction there....    *       *       *       *       *
