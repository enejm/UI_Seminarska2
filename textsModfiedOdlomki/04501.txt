wiggled my toes with entire success. It's well on the cards that I'm all  in one piece and not broken up at all, though I don't see how it could  happen. Right now I don't feel like struggling up and finding out. I'm  fine where I am. I'll just lie here for a while and relax, and get some  of the story on tape.

There was never anything wrong  with the _Whale_ till right at the end and even then I doubt if it was  the ship itself that fouled things up.    "That was some survey assignment.
