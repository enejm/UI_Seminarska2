about, before looking for traces of elephants. Not more than half a mile  from camp we came across a trail broad as a cart-road, evidently made by  a great herd of buffaloes which had passed up at dawn from their feeding  ground in the marshes, to spend the day in the cool air of the uplands.  This trail I followed boldly; for such wind as there was blew straight  down the mountain-side, that is, from the direction in which the  buffaloes had gone, to me. About a mile further on the forest began to  be dense, and the nature of the trail showed me that I must be close to  my game. Another two hundred yards and the bush was so thick that, had  it not been for the trail, we could scarcely have passed through it.  As it was, Gobo, who carried my eight-bore rifle (for I had the  .570-express in my hand), and the other two men whom I had taken with  me, showed the very strongest dislike to going any further, pointing  out that there was ‘no room to run away.’ I told them that they need  not come unless they liked, but that I was certainly going on; and then,  growing ashamed, they came.    “Another fifty yards, and the trail opened into a little glade. I knelt  down and peeped and peered, but no buffalo could I see. Evidently the  herd had broken up here--I knew that from the spoor--and penetrated the  opposite bush in little troops.

I crept on towards him with my heart in my mouth, as gently as  though I were walking upon eggs for a bet, lifting every little bit of  wood in my path, and placing it behind me lest it should crack and warn
