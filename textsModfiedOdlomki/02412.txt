   How many had they brought down? Fifteen? Sixteen? He tore his purple  jacket from his body. The perspiration rolled from his pores. His own  ship would be next. But what did it matter? Kill! Kill! He shouted once  more into the microphone, then dived into battle. Another and another!  In Heaven's name, how many were there? It was maddening. If only he  could breathe. His lungs were seared; his eyes smarting from the heat.  And then it was over.    Three of the Zar's aeros remained, and these turned tail to run for it.  No! They were falling, nose down, under full power; diving into the city  from which they had come. Suicide? Yes. They couldn't face the  recriminations that must come to them. And anything was better than  facing that burning death from the strange little fighters which had  come from out the skies. Dorn was a mass of wreckage.    Karl tore at the fastenings of the ports, searing his fingers on the  heated metal. His pilot had collapsed, the little aero heading madly  skyward with no guiding hand. Air! They must have air! He loosened the  pilot's jacket; slapped frantically at his wrists in the effort to bring  him to consciousness. Then he was at the controls of the vessel, tugging  on first one, then the other. The aero circled and spun, executing the  most dangerous of sideslips and dives. A little voice was speaking to  him--the voice of the radio--instructing him. In a daze he followed  instructions as best he could. The whirlings of the earth stabilized  after a time and he found he was flying the vessel; climbing rapidly.    *       *       *       *       *    A sense of power came to him as the little voice of the radio continued  to instruct. Here were the controls of the electronic motor; there the  gravity-energy. He was proceeding in the wrong direction. But what did  it matter? He learned the meaning of the tiny figures of the altimeter;  the difference between the points of the compass. Still he drove on.
