  "Perhaps I shall be in no danger at all," returned Ozma, with a little  laugh. "You mustn't imagine danger, Dorothy, for one should only  imagine nice things, and we do not know that the Skeezers and Flatheads  are wicked people or my enemies.

I am sure it would be better for me to go  peacefully, without an army and armed only with my authority as Ruler,  and plead with them to obey me. Then, if they prove obstinate I could
