Coo-ee-oh could not or would not help them. The former Queen had no  further thought for her island, her people, or her wonderful magic; she  was only intent on admiring her own beauty.    "Truly," said Ervic, in a gloomy voice, "the Flatheads have conquered  us!"    *     *     *     *     *    Some of these events had been witnessed by Ozma and Dorothy and Lady  Aurex, who had left the house and gone close to the glass of the dome,  in order to see what was going on. Many of the Skeezers had also  crowded against the dome, wondering what would happen next. Although  their vision was to an extent blurred by the water and the necessity of  looking upward at an angle, they had observed the main points of the  drama enacted above. They saw Queen Coo-ee-oh's submarine come to the  surface and open; they saw the Queen standing erect to throw her magic  rope; they saw her sudden transformation into a Diamond Swan, and a cry  of amazement went up from the Skeezers inside the dome.    "Good!" exclaimed Dorothy. "I hate that old Su-dic, but I'm glad  Coo-ee-oh is punished."    "This is a dreadful misfortune!" cried Lady Aurex, pressing her hands  upon her heart.    "Yes," agreed Ozma, nodding her head thoughtfully; "Coo-ee-oh's  misfortune will prove a terrible blow to her people."    "What do you mean by that?" asked Dorothy in surprise. "Seems to me the  Skeezers are in luck to lose their cruel Queen."    "If that were all you would be right," responded Lady Aurex; "and if  the island were above water it would not be so serious. But here we all  are, at the bottom of the lake, and fast prisoners in this dome."    "Can't you raise the island?" inquired Dorothy.    "No. Only Coo-ee-oh knew how to do that," was the answer.    "We can try," insisted Dorothy. "If it can be made to go down, it can  be made to come up. The machinery is still here, I suppose.
