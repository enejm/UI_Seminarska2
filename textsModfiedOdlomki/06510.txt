stones.  It was as well, for ten minutes later the car returned, one of  the occupants waving a hand to me.  Those gentry left nothing to chance.    I finished Turnbull's bread and cheese, and pretty soon I had finished  the stones.  The next step was what puzzled me.  I could not keep up  this roadmaking business for long.  A merciful Providence had kept Mr  Turnbull indoors, but if he appeared on the scene there would be  trouble.  I had a notion that the cordon was still tight round the  glen, and that if I walked in any direction I should meet with  questioners.  But get out I must.  No man's nerve could stand more than  a day of being spied on.    I stayed at my post till five o'clock.  By that time I had resolved to  go down to Turnbull's cottage at nightfall and take my chance of  getting over the hills in the darkness.  But suddenly a new car came up  the road, and slowed down a yard or two from me.  A fresh wind had  risen, and the occupant wanted to light a cigarette.  It was a touring  car, with the tonneau full of an assortment of baggage.  One man sat in  it, and by an amazing chance I knew him.  His name was Marmaduke  Jopley, and he was an offence to creation.  He was a sort of blood  stockbroker, who did his business by toadying eldest sons and rich  young peers and foolish old ladies.  'Marmie' was a familiar figure, I  understood, at balls and polo-weeks and country houses.  He was an  adroit scandal-monger, and would crawl a mile on his belly to anything  that had a title or a million.  I had a business introduction to his  firm when I came to London, and he was good enough to ask me to dinner  at his club.  There he showed off at a great rate, and pattered about  his duchesses till the snobbery of the creature turned me sick.  I  asked a man afterwards why nobody kicked him, and was told that  Englishmen reverenced the weaker sex.
