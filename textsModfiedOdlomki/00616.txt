  "That may not be a wise speech, but it sounds good," said Dorothy  approvingly.  "Ugu the Shoemaker is not only a common man, but he's a  wicked man and a cruel man and deserves to be conquered.  We mustn't  have any mercy on him till Ozma is set free.  So let's go to his castle  as the Frogman says and see what the place looks like."    No one offered any objection to this plan, and so it was adopted. They  broke camp and were about to start on the journey to Ugu's castle when  they discovered that Button-Bright was lost again.  The girls and the  Wizard shouted his name, and the Lion roared and the Donkey brayed and  the Frogman croaked and the Big Lavender Bear growled (to the envy of  Toto, who couldn't growl but barked his loudest), yet none of them  could make Button-Bright hear.  So after vainly searching for the boy a  full hour, they formed a procession and proceeded in the direction of  the wicker castle of Ugu the Shoemaker.    "Button-Bright's always getting lost," said Dorothy.  "And if he wasn't  always getting found again, I'd prob'ly worry.  He may have gone ahead  of us, and he may have gone back, but wherever he is, we'll find him  sometime and somewhere, I'm almost sure."          CHAPTER 19    UGU THE SHOEMAKER      A curious thing about Ugu the Shoemaker was that he didn't suspect in  the least that he was wicked.  He wanted to be powerful and great, and  he hoped to make himself master of all the Land of Oz that he might  compel everyone in that fairy country to obey him, His ambition blinded  him to the rights of others, and he imagined anyone else would act just  as he did if anyone else happened to be as clever as himself.    When he inhabited his little shoemaking shop in the City of Herku, he  had been discontented, for a shoemaker is not looked upon with high  respect, and Ugu knew that his ancestors had been famous magicians for  many centuries past and therefore his family was above the ordinary.
