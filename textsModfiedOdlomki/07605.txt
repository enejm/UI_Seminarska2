The love with which his young wife had inspired him was a secondary  sentiment, and was not strong enough to contend with the primitive  feelings we have just enumerated. Bonacieux indeed reflected on what had  just been said to him.    “But, Monsieur Commissary,” said he, calmly, “believe that I know and  appreciate, more than anybody, the merit of the incomparable eminence by  whom we have the honor to be governed.”    “Indeed?” asked the commissary, with an air of doubt. “If that is really  so, how came you in the Bastille?”    “How I came there, or rather why I am there,” replied Bonacieux, “that  is entirely impossible for me to tell you, because I don’t know myself;  but to a certainty it is not for having, knowingly at least, disobliged  Monsieur the Cardinal.”    “You must, nevertheless, have committed a crime, since you are here and  are accused of high treason.”    “Of high treason!” cried Bonacieux, terrified; “of high treason! How is  it possible for a poor mercer, who detests Huguenots and who abhors  Spaniards, to be accused of high treason? Consider, monsieur, the thing  is absolutely impossible.”    “Monsieur Bonacieux,” said the commissary, looking at the accused as if  his little eyes had the faculty of reading to the very depths of hearts,  “you have a wife?”    “Yes, monsieur,” replied the mercer, in a tremble, feeling that it was  at this point affairs were likely to become perplexing; “that is to say,  I HAD one.”    “What, you ‘had one’? What have you done with her, then, if you have her  no longer?”    “They have abducted her, monsieur.”    “They have abducted her? Ah!”    Bonacieux inferred from this “Ah” that the affair grew more and more  intricate.    “They have abducted her,” added the commissary; “and do you know the man  who has committed this deed?”    “I think I know him.”    “Who is he?”    “Remember that I affirm nothing, Monsieur the Commissary, and that I  only suspect.”    “Whom do you suspect? Come, answer freely.”
