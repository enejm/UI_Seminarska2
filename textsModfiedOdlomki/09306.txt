Elephants, I  supposed, since these are the only creatures worth killing from a money  point of view. But most of my old haunts had been more or less shot out.  The competition of younger professionals, of wandering backveld Boers  and even of poaching natives who had obtained guns, was growing severe.  If I went at all I should have to travel farther afield.
