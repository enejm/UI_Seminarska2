Q. But the others--the ones you called the spies?    A. They weren't there to look at Man, only to watch _me_. They  weren't even sightseeing--they were slumming. However, I think I  am ceasing to be the only one. I think you are coming to know  these things, too.    Q. Very gratifying. Now, as to the latest trip?    A. There seems to have been a slip-up....    Q. _Another_ one?    A. Different. The ones _I_ made were errors in time; this one is  not mine, and it's in hyper-time. I was trying to explain it to a  friend, but he already knew all about it and that led to the  slip-up. It caused it, yet it came afterward.    Q. How annoying for you. How did you explain hyper-time?    A. I said that when an object moves or changes, time is needed as  one of the coordinates to describe that change. I said that  consciousness moves _through_ time--from Monday to  Tuesday--otherwise we would be merely aware of differences without  experiencing them as change. I said that to describe this motion  of consciousness along the dimension of time, _another_ coordinate  is needed: hyper-time.    Q. And the slip-up--which you claim is not yours?    A. Is in hyper-time. It is the result of the Unity and Mankind  affecting one another. You have, through my efforts, examined  them--and thus changed them. Now they begin to examine you--with  the result that _you_ change.    Q. They begin to examine _us_? You must mean they have examined  _you_.
