    CHAPTER II    _The Crash_      At a few minutes before eight o'clock, Air Mail Pilot Steve Chapman  was enjoying a quiet cigarette while waiting for the mechanics to warm  up the five hundred horses of his mail plane satisfactorily. Halfway  through, he heard, from behind, a quick patter of feet, and, turning,  he observed a figure clad in flannel trousers and sweater. The  cigarette dropped right out of his mouth as he cried:    "Ken! Ken Torrance!"    "Thank God you're here!" said Kenneth Torrance. "I gambled on it.  Steve, I've got to borrow your own personal plane."    "What?" gasped Steve Chapman. "What--what--?"    "Listen, Steve.

You've got to help me on  my one chance of bringing the _Peary's_ men out alive! You'll probably  never see the plane again, Steve, but--"    "To hell with the plane, if you come through with yourself and those  men," said the pilot. "All right, kid, I don't get it all, but I'm  playing with you. You're taking my own ship."    He led Ken to a hangar wherein stood a trim five-passenger amphibian;  and very soon that amphibian was roaring out her deep-throated song of  power on the line, itching for the air, and Steve Chapman was shouting  a few last words up to the muffled figure in the enclosed control
