 sort of, uh, thing."    Matheny felt his eloquence running down and grabbed for the second  bottle of beer.    "But where do I start?" he asked plaintively, for his loneliness smote  him anew. "I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even get  to see--"    "It might be arranged," said Doran in a thoughtful tone. "It just  might. How much could you pay this fellow?"
