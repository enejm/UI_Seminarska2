murdered. There was only a negro tale of an apparition which had  appeared in the garden and murdered the master.    Larry and I have found cursory mention of that. But I doubt if the  group of My Lord Howe's gay young blades who were sent north to  capture Major Atwood ever reported exactly what happened to them. The  old Dutch ferryman divulged that he had been hired to ferry the  homecoming major; this, too, is recorded. But Tony Green and his  fellow officers, sent to apprehend the colonial major, found him  inexplicably murdered; and by dawn they were back at the Bowling  Green, white-faced and shaken.    They told some of what had happened to them, but not all. They could  not expect to be believed, for instance, if they said that though they  were unafraid of a negro's tale of a ghost, they had themselves  encountered two ghosts, and had fled the premises!    Those two ghosts were only Larry and Tina!    The negro babbled of a shining cage appearing in the garden. That, of  course, was undoubtedly set down as nonsense. Tony Green and his  friends went to the garden and examined the body of Major Atwood. What  had killed him no one could say. No bullet had struck him. There were  no wounds, no knife thrust, no sword slash. Tony held the lantern with  its swaying yellow glow close to the murdered man's body. The August  night was warm; the garden, banked by trees and shrubbery, was  breathless and oppressively hot; yet the body of Atwood seemed frozen!  He had been dead but a short while, and already the body was stiff.  More than that, it was ice cold. The face, the brows were wet as  though frost had been there and now was melted!    Tony Green's hand shook as he held the lantern. He tried to tell his  comrades that Atwood had died from failure of the heart. Undoubtedly  it was that. He had seen what he supposed was an apparition;  something had frightened him; and a weak heart had brought his death.    *       *       *       *       *
