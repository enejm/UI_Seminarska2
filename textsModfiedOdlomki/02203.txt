"--as far as Slavatsky is concerned, it's just too bad. I'll have four  shots left--and I'm a dead shot at this range. One! Two!"    His lips framed the word "three" and his fingers were tightening on  the trigger when Carson jumped forward with an oath. He pulled a lever  on the wall and the door swung open. Carnes shouted and through the  opened door came a half dozen marines followed by an officer.    "Tie these men up!" snapped Carnes.    *       *       *       *       *    In a trice the six men were securely bound and Frink's bleeding  shoulder was being skilfully treated by two of the marines. Carnes  turned his attention to the unconscious doctor.    He rolled him over on his back and began to chafe his hands. An  officer in a naval uniform came through the door and with a swift  glance around, bent over Dr. Bird. He raised one of the doctor's  eyelids and peered closely at his eye and then sniffed at his breath.    "It's some anesthetic I don't know," he said. "I'll try a stimulant."    He reached in his pocket for a hypodermic, but Carnes interrupted him.    "Earlier in the evening Dr. Bird said they were using lethane," he  said.    "Oh, that new gas the Chemical Warfare Service has discovered," said  the surgeon. "In that case I guess it'll just have to wear off. I know  of nothing that will neutralize it."    Without replying, Carnes began to feverishly search the pockets of the  unconscious scientist. With an exclamation of triumph he drew out a  bottle and uncorked it. A strong smell as of garlic penetrated the  room and he held the opened bottle under Dr. Bird's nose. The doctor  lay for a moment without movement, and then he coughed and sat up half  strangled with tears running down his face.    "Take that confounded bottle away, Carnes!" he said. "Do you want to  strangle me?"
