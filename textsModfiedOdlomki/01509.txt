hull-corridors. A blended horror of sounds came up to us. Screams,  shouts, and the hissing and snapping of ray weapons. Our crew--such of  them as were loyal--were making a stand down below. But it was brief.  Within a minute it died away. The passengers, amidships in the  superstructure, were still shouting. Then above them Miko's roar  sounded.    "Be quiet! Go in your rooms--you will not be harmed."    The brigands in these few minutes were in control of the ship. All but  this little chart-room, where, with most of the ship's weapons, Carter  and I were intrenched.    "God, Gregg, that this should come upon us!"

The heat-beam flashed harmlessly up and struck the turret  roof. Then across the turret window came a sheen of radiance--an  electro-barrage. And behind it, Hahn's suave, evil face appeared. He  shouted down:    "We have orders to spare you, Gregg Haljan--or you would have been
