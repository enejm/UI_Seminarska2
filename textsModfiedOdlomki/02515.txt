that sight. Because the Ragged Men had turned upon Denham with a  concentrated ferocity, somehow knowing instantly that he was more  nearly akin to the men of the Golden City than to them. But at sight  of Evelyn, her garments rent by the thorns of the forest, her white  body gleaming through the largest tears, they seemed to go mad. And  Tommy's eyes, glazing, saw the look on Denham's face as he realized  that Evelyn had not fled, but had followed him in his desperate and  wholly hopeless effort.    Then the swarming mass of Ragged Men surged over the two of them.  Buried them under reaching, hating, lusting fiends who fought even  among themselves to be first to seize them.    Then there was only madness, and Denham was bound beside the man of  the Golden City, and Evelyn was the center of a fighting group which  was suddenly flung aside by the bearded giant, and the encampment of  the Ragged Men was bedlam. And somehow Tommy knew with a terrible  clarity that a man of the Golden City to torture was bliss  unimaginable to these half-mad enemies of that city. But a woman--    He turned from the instrument, three-quarters out of his head. He  literally did not see Von Holtz gazing furtively in the doorway. His  eyes were fixed and staring. It seemed that his brain would burst.    Then he heard his own voice saying with an altogether unbelievable  steadiness:    "Smithers! They've got Evelyn. Get the sub-machine gun."    *       *       *       *       *    Smithers cried out hoarsely. His face was not quite human, for an  instant. But Tommy was bringing the work bench on which he had  installed his magnetic catapult, close over by the dimensoscope.    "This cannot work," he said in the same incredible calmness. "Not  possibly. It should not work. It will not work. But it has to work!"    He was clamping the catapult to a piece of heavy timber.
