   Kennedy remarked that the route tended toward the south; but this  direction was satisfactory to the doctor, who desired to reconnoitre the  tracks of his predecessors as much as possible. It was agreed that the  night should be divided into three watches, so that each of the party  should take his turn in watching over the safety of the rest. The doctor  took the watch commencing at nine o’clock; Kennedy, the one commencing  at midnight; and Joe, the three o’clock morning watch.    So Kennedy and Joe, well wrapped in their blankets, stretched themselves  at full length under the awning, and slept quietly; while Dr. Ferguson  kept on the lookout.        CHAPTER THIRTEENTH.

The sky, covered with clouds, seemed to be laying in supplies for a  fresh deluge.

The sulphuretted  hydrogen emanations, which Captain Burton mentions, could be distinctly  smelt.    “According to his statement, and I think he’s right,” said the doctor,  “one could readily believe that there is a corpse hidden behind every  thicket.”    “An ugly country this!” sighed Joe; “and it seems to me that Mr. Kennedy  is none the better for having passed the night in it.”    “To tell the truth, I have quite a high fever,” said the sportsman.    “There’s nothing remarkable about that, my dear Dick, for we are in one  of the most unhealthy regions in Africa; but we shall not remain here  long; so let’s be off.”
