stares and _What-did-you-says_? In reality, our talk lasted over an  hour.    "I am an Earthman," I said. Through my earphones, when I spoke, I could  faintly hear my own voice as the Zen must have heard it in Vesta's all  but nonexistent atmosphere: tiny, metallic, cricket-like.    "Eert ... mn?"    I pointed at the sky, the incredible sky. "From out there. From another  world."    It thought about that for a while. I waited. We already knew that the  Zens had been better astronomers at their peak than we were right now,  even though they'd never mastered space travel; so I didn't expect this  one to boggle at the notion of creatures from another world.
