had gone down on all fours and was snuffing and rooting, like a  veritable hog, at the surface of the arena. A moment and it rose to its  feet, clutching upward, with an expression of desire upon its face such  as I have never seen in this world.    Continually, I mounted higher. A few minutes, it seemed, and I had  risen above the great mountains--floating, alone, afar in the redness.  At a tremendous distance below, the arena showed, dimly; with the mighty  House looking no larger than a tiny spot of green. The Swine-thing was  no longer visible.    Presently, I passed over the mountains, out above the huge breadth of  the plain. Far away, on its surface, in the direction of the ring-shaped  sun, there showed a confused blur.
