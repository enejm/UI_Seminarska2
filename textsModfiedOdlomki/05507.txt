  Now--while Ku Sui's attention was on him--now was the time! Now!  Otherwise the Eurasian would turn him over and see that he was white!    It seemed to Ban centuries later that he heard the welcome voice of  the Hawk bark out:    "You are covered, Dr. Ku! And your men. I advise you not to move. Tell  your men to drop their guns--_sh!_"    The sound of the voice from the guard-chamber was replaced by two  spits of a raygun. Unable to restrain himself, Ban rolled over and  looked up.    He saw, first, the figure of the Hawk. Carse had stepped out from  where he had been concealed, in the guard-chamber, and was holding the  gun that had just spoken.

And in the silence, Ban Wilson, watchful,  with a raygun he had drawn from his belt, fancied he could _feel_ the  long, bitter, bloody feud between the two, adventurer and scientist,
