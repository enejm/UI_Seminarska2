"Yes," Marge said flatly.    "Look, Marge!" I said in feverish excitement. "I've got to talk to  Elmer! I've got to get the rights to that TV color lens and this  electricity interruptor and anything else he may have developed!"    Marge kept trying to protest, but I simply grabbed her and Doreen and  hustled them out to my car. Doreen lived in a wooded, hilly section a  little north of White Plains. I made it in ten minutes.    *       *       *       *       *    Marge had said Elmer worked in the garage. I kept going up the driveway,  swung sharp around the big house--and slammed on the brakes.    Marge screamed.    We skidded to a stop with our front end hanging over what looked like a  bomb crater in the middle of the driveway.    I swallowed my heart down again, while I backed away fast.    We had almost plunged into a hole forty feet across and twenty feet deep  in the middle. The hole was perfectly round, like a half section of a  grapefruit.    "What's this?" I asked. "Where's the garage?"    "That's where the garage should be." Marge looked dazed. "But it's  gone!"    I took another look at that hole scooped out with geometrical precision,  and turned to Doreen. "What did you say Elmer was working on?"    "Agg--" she sobbed, "agg--agg--aggravation." She began to bawl in  earnest. "Now he's gone. He's mad. He won't ever come back, I betcha."    "That's a fact," I muttered. "He may not have been mad, but he certainly  was aggravated. Marge, listen! This is a mystery. We've just got to let  it stay a mystery. We don't know anything, understand? The cops will  finally decide Elmer blew himself up, and we'll leave it at that. One  thing I'm pretty sure about--he's not coming back."    *       *       *       *       *
