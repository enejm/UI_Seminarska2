It was a very anxious day, for although the  place was so wild and lonely, there was always the fear lest we should  be discovered. It was true that we had travelled mostly by night in  small parties, to avoid leaving a spoor, and avoided all kraals; still,  some rumour of our approach might have reached the Amakoba, or a party  of hunters might stumble on us, or those who sought for lost cattle.
