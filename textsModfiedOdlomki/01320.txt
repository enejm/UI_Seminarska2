"Go to the bank and get $200,000 in fifties and one hundreds," he  commanded.    When the clerk returned with the money he laid the package on his desk  and left the desk open. "This might appear cowardly, but it will give us  time," he said. Lees did not offer an opinion.    Ferguson drew a personal note for $200,000 and sent it to the Schefert  Corporation's attorneys. This amount represented a large part of  Ferguson's personal assets, not involved with any company with which he  was connected. He told Lees to go about his further investigations. Then  he left the office and started for his home. "I'll bank my life Lees  will have those crooks lined up within a week," he assured himself as he  lolled in his auto, bound homeward. But his voice sounded hollow, and  the blood still pounded at his temples.    *       *       *       *       *    Reaching home, he found a call from the western plant, at Chicago. He  phoned the superintendent with a foreboding that all was not well.    "This you, Perk?" sounded the voice on the wire.    "Yes, what's up?"    "I had not intended bothering you with this, but in the light of all  that has happened I guess you had better know that one of our engineers  went stark mad out here about three weeks ago. He was a very brainy man  but his reason snapped. He first appeared queer when he began talking of  anarchy and cursing capitalists. Then one afternoon he struck a shop  foreman down with a heavy wrench and rushed out of the plant. We have  not seen him since. The police have been looking for him, but he is  still at large."    "That explains a lot of things," said "Old Perk." "Tell the police to  keep after him. We'll look for him here. File me a complete detailed  report of the incident by telegraph," he instructed. Then he asked:    "How is the foreman? Badly hurt?"
