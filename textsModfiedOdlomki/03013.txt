  Matheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him  want to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe  he became overcautious.    They had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must.    "I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea," he  said slowly. "But it would have to be under security."    "Okay by me. Room service can send us up an oath box right now."    "What? But--but--" Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that  he had landed on Earth less than six hours ago.    In the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in.  Doran swallowed the pill and donned the conditioner helmet without an  instant's hesitation.    "I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever  you may tell me under security, now or at any other time," he  recited. Then, cheerfully: "And that formula, Pete, happens to be the  honest-to-zebra truth."    "I know." Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. "I'm sorry  to--to--I mean of course I trust you, but--"    "Forget it. I take a hundred security oaths a year, in my line of work.  Maybe I can help you. I like you, Pete, damn if I don't. And, sure,  I might stand to get an agent's cut, if I arrange--Go ahead, boy, go  ahead." Doran crossed his legs and leaned back.    "Oh, it's simple enough," said Matheny. "It's only that we already are  operating con games."    "On Mars, you mean?"    "Yes. There never were any Old Martians. We erected the ruins fifty  years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been  manufacturing relics ever since."    "_Huh?_ Well, why, but--"    "In this case, it helps to be at the far end of an interplanetary  haul," said Matheny. "Not many Terrestrial archeologists get to Mars  and they depend on our people to--Well, anyhow--"    "I will be clopped! Good for you!"    *       *       *       *       *
