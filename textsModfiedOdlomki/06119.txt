in Gdynia defuse the thing after it was put on board the ship, but  otherwise leave it entirely alone.    "Actually, you see, your hunch was right on the button as far as it  went. We didn't ask you whether or not that object was a live bomb. We  asked whether it was a bomb or not. You said it was, and you were  right."    The expression on Braun's face was exactly like the one he had worn  while he had been searching for his decision--except that, since his  eyes were open, I could see that it was directed at me.
