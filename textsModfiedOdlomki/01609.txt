recapitulate very briefly what has happened so far:    Unscrupulous Martian brigands were scheming for Johnny Grantline's  secret radium-ore treasure, dug out of the Moon and waiting there to be  picked up by the _Planetara_ on her return trip from Mars.    The _Planetara_ left, bound for Mars, some ten days away. Suspicious  interplanetary passengers were aboard: Miko and Moa, a brother and a  sister of Mars; Sir Arthur Coniston, a mysterious Englishman; Ob Hahn, a  Venus mystic. And small, effeminate George Prince and his sister, Anita.  Love, I think, was born instantly between Anita and me. I found all too  soon that Miko, the sinister giant from Mars, also desired her.
