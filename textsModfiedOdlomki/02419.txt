reeled on his feet, as though black alcohol had befuddled him, then he  steadied himself, flung both arms above his head, and rolled out a  command which burst upon Kirby's ears like thunder.    It was as if the whole cavern of the lower world, and the whole of the  round earth itself, had been rocked uneasily, dreadfully by the  bellowing, crashing explosion of the drums. Maddened by the turmoil he  had let loose, the gargoyle-faced giant ape-man leered about him with  blood-shot, drunken eyes, and beat on his cicatrized chest with massive  fists. Suddenly he let out a bellow. Straight up into the air he sprang  in a wild leap. When he came down, he was dancing, and the portentious,  the sickeningly mysterious ceremony for which such solemn preparation  had been made, was begun.    Kirby drew a rasping breath. Knowing that there must be some definite  reason for the dance having begun just when and as it had, he looked  beyond the solitary dancing giant, on beyond the crowded legions of the  apes, toward the village. There, where the main trail from the community  approached the clearing, he saw precisely the thing which he had both  hoped desperately and dreaded terribly to find.    *       *       *       *       *    Headed directly toward the clearing, moving down the trail with slow,  majestic pace, came a procession headed by a bodyguard of ape-men and  augmented by other men whose nakedness was covered by unmistakable,  unforgetable priestly robes of gray.    All at once the ape-people in the clearing began to scuffle apart,  opening a lane down which the procession might pass to the central  stage with its dancer, its ink spot orifice, and its fangs of tall  poles. Kirby, watching the congregation, watching the majestic approach  of gray robes through the night, wiped away from his forehead a sweat of  fear.    "I think," Nini called in a voice pitched high to outsound the drums,  "that the--the Duca is with them!"
