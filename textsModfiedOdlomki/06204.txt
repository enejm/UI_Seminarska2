  "This doctrine is wind," the Spokesman said. "And it is plainly intended  to undercut authority and the order established by the Book. Tell me,  pursemaker: if men need not fear the Giants, why should they fear the  law?"    "Because they are men, and it is to their interest to fear the law. They  aren't children, who need some physical Giant sitting over them with a  whip to make them behave. Furthermore, Spokesman, this archaic belief  _itself_ undermines us. As long as we believe that there are real  Giants, and that some day they'll return and resume teaching us, so long  will we fail to seek answers to our questions for ourselves. Half of  what we know was given to us in the Book, and the other half is supposed  to drop to us from the skies if we wait long enough. In the meantime, we  vegetate."    "If a part of the Book be untrue, there can be nothing to prevent that  it is all untrue," the Spokesman said heavily. "And we will lose even  what you call the half of our knowledge--which is actually the whole of  it--to those who see with clear eyes."    Suddenly, Honath lost his temper. "Lose it, then!" he shouted. "Let us  unlearn everything we know only by rote, go back to the beginning, learn  all over again, and _continue_ to learn, from our own experience.  Spokesman, you are an old man, but there are still some of us who  haven't forgotten what curiosity means!"    "Quiet!" the Spokesman said. "We have heard enough. We call on Alaskon  the Navigator."    "Much of the Book is clearly untrue," Alaskon said flatly, rising. "As a  handbook of small trades it has served us well. As a guide to how the  universe is made, it is nonsense, in my opinion; Honath is too kind to  it. I've made no secret of what I think, and I still think it."    "And will pay for it," the Spokesman said, blinking slowly down at  Alaskon. "Charl the Reader."    "Nothing," Charl said, without standing, or even looking up.    "You do not deny the charges?"
