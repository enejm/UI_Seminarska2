talked about the 'German menace', and said it was all a Tory invention  to cheat the poor of their rights and keep back the great flood of  social reform, but that 'organized labour' realized this and laughed  the Tories to scorn.  He was all for reducing our Navy as a proof of  our good faith, and then sending Germany an ultimatum telling her to do  the same or we would knock her into a cocked hat.  He said that, but  for the Tories, Germany and Britain would be fellow-workers in peace  and reform.  I thought of the little black book in my pocket!  A giddy  lot Scudder's friends cared for peace and reform.    Yet in a queer way I liked the speech.  You could see the niceness of  the chap shining out behind the muck with which he had been spoon-fed.  Also it took a load off my mind.  I mightn't be much of an orator, but  I was a thousand per cent better than Sir Harry.    I didn't get on so badly when it came to my turn.  I simply told them  all I could remember about Australia, praying there should be no  Australian there--all about its labour party and emigration and  universal service.  I doubt if I remembered to mention Free Trade, but  I said there were no Tories in Australia, only Labour and Liberals.  That fetched a cheer, and I woke them up a bit when I started in to  tell them the kind of glorious business I thought could be made out of  the Empire if we really put our backs into it.    Altogether I fancy I was rather a success.  The minister didn't like  me, though, and when he proposed a vote of thanks, spoke of Sir Harry's  speech as 'statesmanlike' and mine as having 'the eloquence of an  emigration agent'.    When we were in the car again my host was in wild spirits at having got  his job over.  'A ripping speech, Twisdon,' he said.  'Now, you're  coming home with me.  I'm all alone, and if you'll stop a day or two  I'll show you some very decent fishing.'
