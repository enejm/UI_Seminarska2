"We don't need that, whatever it is!"    He rubbed his knuckles where the violet waves had tinged them, and  turned grimly back to Snap.    "Where are your Gamma ray mirrors? If the treasure is exposed--"    This Martian's knowledge was far greater than we believed. He grinned  sardonically at Anita. "If our treasure is on this hemisphere, Prince,  we should pick up Gamma rays? Don't you think so? Or is Grantline so  cautious it will all be protected?"    Anita spoke in a careful, throaty drawl. "The Gamma rays came plain  enough when we passed here on the way out."    "You should know," grinned Miko. "An expert eavesdropper, Prince--I will  say that for you. Come Dean, try something else. By God, if Grantline  does not signal us, I will be likely to blame you--my patience is  shortening. Shall we go closer, Haljan?"    "I don't think it would help," I said.    He nodded. "Perhaps not. Are we checked?"    "Yes." We were poised, very nearly motionless. "If you wish an advance,  I can ring it. But we need a surface destination now."    "True, Haljan." He stood thinking. "Would a zed-ray penetrate those  crater-cliffs? Tycho, for instance, at this angle?"[B]    "It might," Snap agreed. "You think he may be on the Northern inner side  of Tycho?"    "He may be anywhere," said Miko shortly.    "If you think that," Snap persisted, "suppose we swing the _Planetara_  over the South Pole. Tycho, viewed from there--"    "And take another quarter-day of time?" Miko sneered. "Flash on your  zed-ray; help him hook it up, Haljan."      [B] An allusion to the use of the zed-ray light for making  spectro-photographs of what might be behind obscuring rock masses,  similar to the old-style X-ray.    *       *       *       *       *    I moved to the lens-box of the spectroheliograph. It seemed that Snap
