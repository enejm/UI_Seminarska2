He took Northwood to a laboratory crowded with strange apparatus, where  young men and women worked. Northwood knew instantly that these people,  although unusually handsome and strong, were not of Adam's generation.  None of them had the look of newness which marked those who had grown up  under the Life Ray.    "They are the perfect couples whom I combed the world to find," said the  scientist. "From their eugenic marriages sprang the first children that  passed through the laboratory. I had hoped," he hesitated and looked  sideways at Northwood, "I had dreamed of having the children of you and  Athalia to help strengthen the New Race."    A wave of sudden disgust passed over Northwood.    "Thanks," he said tartly. "When I marry Athalia, I intend to have an  old-fashioned home and a Black Age family. I don't relish having my  children turned into--experiments."    "But wait until you see all the wonders of the laboratory! That is why I  am showing you all this."

The more I see, the more pity I have for Adam--and the less I  blame him for his rebellion and his desire to kill and to rule. Heavens!

He raised his voice and called, "Lilith!"    The woman whom they had met on the field came forward.    "May we take a peep at Lona's twins?" asked the scientist. "They are
