 "If this here, now, Javary fever ain't catchin', how does a feller git  it?"    "Mosquitoes," McKay enlightened him. "The _anopheles_. It bites a man  who has fever, then bites a well man and leaves the fever in him. Inside  of ten days he's sick, unless he takes a huge dose of quinine right  away. Mosquito attacks perpendicular to the skin. That is, it stands on  its head. If you ever notice one of them biting that way get busy with  the quinine."    "Huh! Fat chance a feller's got o' seein' just how all these bugs bite  him. And one muskeeter standin' on its head does all that, hey?"    "So they say. Also they say it's only the female that bites."    "Yeah. I believe it. I been stung more 'n once by females before now.  How about the yeller fever? Git that the same way?"    "Same way, only a different mosquito--the _stegomyia_. When you begin to  vomit black you're gone. And if you get beriberi you're gone, too. First  symptoms of that are numbness of the fingers and toes. Muscular  paralysis goes on until your heart stops."    "Uh-huh. Nice cheerful place to die in, this Ammyzon jungle. Aw well,  what's the odds?"    Wherewith he inhaled more coffee, flipped his cigarette butt at a small  lizard on the floor not far away, yawned once more, and swaggered out to  the piazza, bawling:    "And when I die  Don't bury me a-tall,  But pickle me bones  In alky-hawl--"    When his roar had subsided and the two former officers had sat silent a  moment, smiling over his nocturnal adventures, the door of Schwandorf's  room opened abruptly and the German stepped out.    "_Morgen_," he grunted, striding to the table. "Thomaz!"    "_Si_, Senhor Sssondoff." The youth faded away into the kitchen  quarters.    "Always feel grumpy until I eat," grumbled the blackbeard. "None of this  coffee-cigarette breakfast for me. A real meal, coffee with gin in it, a  cigar--then I feel human. Sleep well?"
