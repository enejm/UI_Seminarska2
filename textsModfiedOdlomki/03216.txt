   "I can't make policy."    "In other words, mama knows best. Believe, obey, anything put out by  some bureaucrat who never set foot beyond Luna. Is that your idea of  citizenship?"    "You're putting a mighty fine gloss on bailing yourself out!"  Janichevski flared.    "Sure, I'm no idealist. But neither am I a slave," Blades hesitated.
