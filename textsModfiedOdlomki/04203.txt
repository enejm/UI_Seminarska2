should she ever divorce him for cruelty or mistreatment. But that had  been only innate shrewdness. She would still have married him had he  refused her demands for her family. For his wealth fascinated her, and  the prospect of being a virtual queen, even of a distant outpost colony  such as that on Callisto, appealed to her.    And she had thought that she was taking little risk, for if she were  dissatisfied, the law these days was very lenient toward unhappy  marital relationships. It required only definite proof of misconduct,  mistreatment, or oppression of any kind to win freedom from an unwanted  partner. Nanlo had been confident that after a year or two she would be  able to shake free of the bonds uniting her to Negu Mah and take flight  for herself into a world made vastly more pleasant by the marriage  settlement remaining to her.    But now she had been married, and had lived on Callisto, for a full  five years, and her tolerance of Negu Mah had long since turned to  bitter hate. Not because he was a bad husband, but because he was too  good a one!    *      *      *      *      *    There was an ironic humor in the situation, but Nanlo was not disposed  to recognize it. Lenient as the law was, yet it required some grounds  before it could free her. And she had no grounds whatever. Negu Mah was  at all times the model of courtesy and consideration toward her. He  granted every reasonable wish and some that were unreasonable--although  when he refused one of the latter, it was with a firmness as  unshakeable as a rock.    Their home was as fine as any on earth. She had more than adequate help  in taking care of it. She had ample time for any pursuits that  interested her. But she used it only to become more and more bitter  against Negu Mah because she could find no excuse to divorce him.
