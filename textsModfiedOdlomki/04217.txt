  "Yet," the uranium merchant went on, "I have a fondness for Nanlo. I  will not prevent her from doing as she has chosen to do, for the intent  would still be there, and knowing it as I do, all between us is over. I  can not aid her to fulfill her plans, either, for that is to injure her  and myself too. But there is another course. I have chosen that."    He gestured with one plump hand toward the silhouetted ship.    "I believe they have entered the Vulcan," he announced. "I saw light as  the entrance port opened then."    The amphibian's great, frog head nodded agreement.    "So," Negu Mah continued, "I have decided to exercise what indulgence I  can in the face of the injury they would do me. They shall have their  chance."    He fell silent again. Sliss leaned forward in his tub. Both of them  watched intently. A flare of greenish light had sprung up beneath the  black pillar that was the Vulcan. For just an instant the freighter  stood there, green radiance expanding around her. Then she leaped into  the sky.    With her leap, she seemed to suck the radiance along. It became a great  cone of glowing light that, arrow-like, raced away upward. For a long  instant the black length of the ship, and the greenish fan of flame,  were outlined against the scarlet background of Jupiter. Then the  freighter rocket, flinging herself upward at three gravities or better,  passed the edge of the planet and vanished.    Negu Mah sat very quiet for some moments. But at last he stirred again.  Sliss' eyes turned toward him, immobile.    "Sometimes love transforms the weak," the uranium merchant said slowly.  "Like fire giving temper to soft metal. Sometimes a mutual love will  endure for all eternity, and the two who share it will gain from it a  soul they did not have before. Nanlo and Hugh Neils have this chance.  Both said they wanted only the other, and their love, for all eternity.  To gain this, both were willing to cheat, to steal, to dishonor me and  themselves.
