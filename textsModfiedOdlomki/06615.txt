we would have a try for horses or a lift in some passing wagon.  I had  no hope of another car.  Every automobile in Anatolia would now be at a  premium.    It was so disgusting a mishap that we all took it quietly.  It was too  bad to be helped by hard swearing.  Hussin and Peter set off on  different sides of the road to prospect for a house, and Blenkiron and  I sheltered under the nearest rock and smoked savagely.    Hussin was the first to strike oil.  He came back in twenty minutes  with news of some kind of dwelling a couple of miles up the stream.
