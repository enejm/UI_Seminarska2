avidity. The doctor recognized the fruit of the “mbenbu”--tree which  grows in profusion, on the western part of Jihoue-la-Mkoa. Ferguson  waited for Joe with a certain feeling of impatience, for even a short  halt in this inhospitable region always inspires a degree of fear.    The water was got aboard without trouble, as the car was nearly resting  on the ground. Joe then found it easy to loosen the anchor and leaped  lightly to his place beside the doctor. The latter then replenished the  flame in the cylinder, and the balloon majestically soared into the air.    It was then about one hundred miles from Kazeh, an important  establishment in the interior of Africa, where, thanks to a  south-southeasterly current, the travellers might hope to arrive on that  same day. They were moving at the rate of fourteen miles per hour, and  the guidance of the balloon was becoming difficult, as they dared not  rise very high without extreme dilation of the gas, the country itself  being at an average height of three thousand feet. Hence, the doctor  preferred not to force the dilation, and so adroitly followed the  sinuosities of a pretty sharply-inclined plane, and swept very close  to the villages of Thembo and Tura-Wels. The latter forms part of  the Unyamwezy, a magnificent country, where the trees attain enormous  dimensions; among them the cactus, which grows to gigantic size.    About two o’clock, in magnificent weather, but under a fiery sun that  devoured the least breath of air, the balloon was floating over the town  of Kazeh, situated about three hundred and fifty miles from the coast.    “We left Zanzibar at nine o’clock in the morning,” said the doctor,  consulting his notes, “and, after two days’ passage, we have, including  our deviations, travelled nearly five hundred geographical miles.  Captains Burton and Speke took four months and a half to make the same  distance!”        CHAPTER FIFTEENTH.
