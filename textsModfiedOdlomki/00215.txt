"Of course; in just a jiffy. And Ozma has an enchanted picture hanging  in her room that shows her the exact scene where any of her friends may  be, at any time she chooses. All she has to do is to say: 'I wonder what  So-and-so is doing,' and at once the picture shows where her friend is  and what the friend is doing. That's _real_ magic, Mr. Wizard; isn't it?  Well, every day at four o'clock Ozma has promised to look at me in that  picture, and if I am in need of help I am to make her a certain sign and  she will put on the Nome King's Magic Belt and wish me to be with her in  Oz."    "Do you mean that Princess Ozma will see this cave in her enchanted  picture, and see all of us here, and what we are doing?" demanded Zeb.    "Of course; when it is four o'clock," she replied, with a laugh at his  startled expression.    "And when you make a sign she will bring you to her in the Land of Oz?"  continued the boy.    "That's it, exactly; by means of the Magic Belt."    "Then," said the Wizard, "you will be saved, little Dorothy; and I am  very glad of it. The rest of us will die much more cheerfully when we  know you have escaped our sad fate."    "_I_ won't die cheerfully!" protested the kitten. "There's nothing  cheerful about dying that I could ever see, although they say a cat has  nine lives, and so must die nine times."    "Have you ever died yet?" enquired the boy.    "No, and I'm not anxious to begin," said Eureka.    "Don't worry, dear," Dorothy exclaimed, "I'll hold you in my arms, and  take you with me."    "Take us, too!" cried the nine tiny piglets, all in one breath.    "Perhaps I can," answered Dorothy. "I'll try."    "Couldn't you manage to hold me in your arms?" asked the cab-horse.    Dorothy laughed.    "I'll do better than that," she promised, "for I can easily save you  all, once I am myself in the Land of Oz."
