'I'm Hannay all right.  For God's sake don't wink an eye.  I'm here on  a secret job.'    The doctor had turned to see what was the matter.  I got a few more  words in.  'Cheer up, old man.  We're winning hands down.'    Then I began to talk excited Dutch and finished the collection of the  cards.  Dolly was playing his part well, smiling as if he was amused by  the antics of a monkey.  The others were coming back, the  deputy-commandant with an angry light in his dull eye.  'Speaking to  the prisoners is forbidden,' he shouted.    I looked blankly at him till the lieutenant translated.    'What kind of fellow is he?' said Dolly in English to the doctor. 'He  spoils my game and then jabbers High-Dutch at me.'    Officially I knew English, and that speech of Dolly's gave me my cue.  I pretended to be very angry with the very damned Englishman, and went  out of the room close by the deputy-commandant, grumbling like a sick  jackal.  After that I had to act a bit.  The last place we visited was  the close-confinement part where prisoners were kept as a punishment  for some breach of the rules.  They looked cheerless enough, but I  pretended to gloat over the sight, and said so to the lieutenant, who  passed it on to the others.  I have rarely in my life felt such a cad.    On the way home the lieutenant discoursed a lot about prisoners and  detention-camps, for at one time he had been on duty at Ruhleben.  Peter, who had been in quod more than once in his life, was deeply  interested and kept on questioning him.  Among other things he told us  was that they often put bogus prisoners among the rest, who acted as  spies.  If any plot to escape was hatched these fellows got into it and  encouraged it.  They never interfered till the attempt was actually  made and then they had them on toast.  There was nothing the Boche  liked so much as an excuse for sending a poor devil to 'solitary'.
