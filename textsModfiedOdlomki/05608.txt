 but inside that effect was lost. There were the usual appurtenances: a  maze of pipes, wheels, machinery, all silent now, and cold; here were  the two port-locks for torpoons; the emergency steering controls; the  small staterooms of the _Peary's_ officers. Looking forward, still  striving for complete clear-headedness and normality, Ken could see  the two intact forward compartments, silent and apparently lifeless,  with dim lamps burning.
