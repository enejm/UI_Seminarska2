"You'll want to know if the ship worked. Well, she did. Went like a  bomb. We got lined up between Earth and Mars, you'll remember, and James  pushed the button marked 'Jump'. Took his finger off the button and  there we were: _Alpha Centauri_. Two months later your time, one second  later by us. We covered our whole survey assignment like that, smooth as  a pint of old and mild which right now I could certainly use. Better yet  would be a pint of hot black coffee with sugar in. Failing that, I could  even go for a long drink of cold water. There was never anything wrong  with the _Whale_ till right at the end and even then I doubt if it was  the ship itself that fouled things up.    "That was some survey assignment.

I'd told you how we happened to find Chang, hadn't  I? That's what the natives called it. Walking, talking natives on a blue  sky planet with 1.1 g gravity and a twenty per cent oxygen atmosphere at  fifteen p.s.i. The odds against finding Chang on a six-sun survey on the  first star jump ever must be up in the googols. We certainly were lucky.    "The Chang natives aren't very technical--haven't got space travel for  instance. They're good astronomers, though. We were able to show them  our sun, in their telescopes. In their way, they're a highly civilized
