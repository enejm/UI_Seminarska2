interesting case in her Throne Room, Cap'n Bill managed to carry the  golden flower-pot containing the Magic Flower up to Trot's room without  it being seen by anyone except Jellia Jamb, Ozma's chief Maid of Honor,  and Jellia promised not to tell.    Also the Wizard was able to carry the cage of monkeys up to one of the  top towers of the palace, where he had a room of his own, to which no  one came unless invited.  So Trot and Dorothy and Cap'n Bill and the  Wizard were all delighted at the successful end of their adventure.  The Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger went to the marble stables  behind the Royal Palace, where they lived while at home, and they too  kept the secret, even refusing to tell the Wooden Sawhorse, and Hank  the Mule, and the Yellow Hen, and the Pink Kitten where they had been.    Trot watered the Magic Flower every day and allowed no one in her room  to see the beautiful blossoms except her friends, Betsy Bobbin and  Dorothy.  The wonderful plant did not seem to lose any of its magic by  being removed from its island, and Trot was sure that Ozma would prize  it as one of her most delightful treasures.    Up in his tower the little Wizard of Oz began training his twelve tiny  monkeys, and the little creatures were so intelligent that they learned  every trick the Wizard tried to teach them.  The Wizard treated them  with great kindness and gentleness and gave them the food that monkeys  love best, so they promised to do their best on the great occasion of  Ozma's birthday.          22.  Ozma's Birthday Party      It seems odd that a fairy should have a birthday, for fairies, they  say, were born at the beginning of time and live forever.  Yet, on the  other hand, it would be a shame to deprive a fairy, who has so many  other good things, of the delights of a birthday.  So we need not  wonder that the fairies keep their birthdays just as other folks do,  and consider them occasions for feasting and rejoicing.
