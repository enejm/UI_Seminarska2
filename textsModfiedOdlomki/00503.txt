reached as high as the heads of the two girls, neither of whom was very  tall. They were obliged to thread their way in and out, until Dorothy  was afraid they would get lost, and finally they were halted by a  curious thing that barred their further progress. It was a huge web--as  if woven by gigantic spiders--and the delicate, lacy film was fastened  stoutly to the branches of the bushes and continued to the right and  left in the form of a half circle. The threads of this web were of a  brilliant purple color and woven into numerous artistic patterns, but  it reached from the ground to branches above the heads of the girls and  formed a sort of fence that hedged them in.    "It doesn't look very strong, though," said Dorothy. "I wonder if we  couldn't break through." She tried but found the web stronger than it  seemed. All her efforts could not break a single thread.    "We must go back, I think, and try to get around this peculiar web,"  Ozma decided.    So they turned to the right and, following the web found that it seemed  to spread in a regular circle. On and on they went until finally Ozma  said they had returned to the exact spot from which they had started.  "Here is a handkerchief you dropped when we were here before," she said  to Dorothy.    "In that case, they must have built the web behind us, after we walked  into the trap," exclaimed the little girl.    "True," agreed Ozma, "an enemy has tried to imprison us."    "And they did it, too," said Dorothy. "I wonder who it was."    "It's a spider-web, I'm quite sure," returned Ozma, "but it must be the  work of enormous spiders."    "Quite right!" cried a voice behind them. Turning quickly around they  beheld a huge purple spider sitting not two yards away and regarding  them with its small bright eyes.    Then there crawled from the bushes a dozen more great purple spiders,  which saluted the first one and said:    "The web is finished, O King, and the strangers are our prisoners."
