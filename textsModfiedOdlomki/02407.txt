  McGuire's mind held only the desire to kill, and he would have begun a  staggering rush toward the shrieking mob that broke from the cover  behind them, had not Sykes held him fast. At sight of the weapon, their  own gas projector, still clutched in the flyer's hand, the pursuers  halted. Their long arms pointed and their shrill calls joined in a  chorus that quavered and fell uncertainly.    *       *       *       *       *    One, braver than the rest, dashed forward and discharged his weapon.
