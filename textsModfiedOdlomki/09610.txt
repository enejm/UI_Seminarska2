 “I’ll do nothing of the sort--no more will you!” said I. “I utterly  refuse to take part in making a fool of the princess.”    Sapt looked at me with his small keen eyes. A slow cunning smile passed  over his face.    “All right, lad, all right,” said he. “We mustn’t press you too hard.  Soothe her down a bit, if you can, you know. Now for Michael!”    “Oh, damn Michael!” said I. “He’ll do tomorrow. Here, Fritz, come for a  stroll in the garden.”    Sapt at once yielded. His rough manner covered a wonderful tact--and  as I came to recognize more and more, a remarkable knowledge of human  nature. Why did he urge me so little about the princess? Because he  knew that her beauty and my ardour would carry me further than all his  arguments--and that the less I thought about the thing, the more likely  was I to do it. He must have seen the unhappiness he might bring on the  princess; but that went for nothing with him. Can I say, confidently,  that he was wrong? If the King were restored, the princess must turn to  him, either knowing or not knowing the change. And if the King were not  restored to us? It was a subject that we had never yet spoken of.

He would have set Satan himself there  sooner than that pupil of his, Black Michael.      The ball was a sumptuous affair. I opened it by dancing a quadrille  with Flavia: then I waltzed with her. Curious eyes and eager whispers  attended us. We went in to supper; and, half way through, I, half mad by  then, for her glance had answered mine, and her quick breathing met my  stammered sentences--I rose in my place before all the brilliant crowd,  and taking the Red Rose that I wore, flung the ribbon with its jewelled  badge round her neck. In a tumult of applause I sat down: I saw Sapt  smiling over his wine, and Fritz frowning. The rest of the meal passed
