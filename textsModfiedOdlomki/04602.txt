 Zotul bowed his head meekly, but he burned with resentment.    "Listen to the boy," said the aged father. "There is more wisdom in his  head than in all the rest of you. Forget the Earthmen and think only of  the clay."    Zotul did not appreciate his father's approval, for it only earned him  a beating as soon as the old man went to bed. It was a common enough  thing among the brothers Masur, as among everybody, to be frustrated in  their desires. However, they had Zotul to take it out upon, and they  did.

There was also some talk going around about agreements made between
