    We made the remains of our rope fast to the other canoe, and sat waiting  for the dawn and congratulating ourselves upon our merciful escape,  which really seemed to result more from the special favour of Providence  than from our own care or prowess. At last it came, and I have not  often been more grateful to see the light, though so far as my canoe was  concerned it revealed a ghastly sight. There in the bottom of the little  boat lay the unfortunate Askari, the sime, or sword, in his bosom, and  the severed hand gripping the handle. I could not bear the sight, so  hauling up the stone which had served as an anchor to the other canoe,  we made it fast to the murdered man and dropped him overboard, and down  he went to the bottom, leaving nothing but a train of bubbles behind  him. Alas! when our time comes, most of us like him leave nothing but  bubbles behind, to show that we have been, and the bubbles soon burst.  The hand of his murderer we threw into the stream, where it slowly sank.  The sword, of which the handle was ivory, inlaid with gold (evidently  Arab work), I kept and used as a hunting-knife, and very useful it  proved.    Then, a man having been transferred to my canoe, we once more started on  in very low spirits and not feeling at all comfortable as to the future,  but fondly hoping to arrive at the ‘Highlands’ station by night. To make  matters worse, within an hour of sunrise it came on to rain in torrents,  wetting us to the skin, and even necessitating the occasional baling  of the canoes, and as the rain beat down the wind we could not use the  sails, and had to get along as best as we could with our paddles.    At eleven o’clock we halted on an open piece of ground on the left bank  of the river, and, the rain abating a little, managed to make a fire and  catch and broil some fish. We did not dare to wander about to search for  game. At two o’clock we got off again, taking a supply of broiled fish
