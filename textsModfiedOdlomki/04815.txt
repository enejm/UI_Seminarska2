  *       *       *       *       *    Swanson didn't look like the general conception of a small-town  newspaperman. One knew instinctively that his beard wouldn't have been  tobacco-stained even if he'd cared to grow one. And he didn't have a  bottle of bourbon in the file marked Miscellaneous, or if he did he  didn't bring it out.    "That never came from my paper," he said precisely. He handed the  clipping back to Jim. "We don't use that type, for one thing. For  another, Miss Simmons, so far as I know, wasn't killed here or anywhere  else."    "You knew her?"    "I knew of her. I never met her."    "What about this report of her death?"    Swanson shrugged; tented manicured fingers. "It's a hoax. Any job  printing shop with a Linotype could do it. In all likelihood it was some  place in San Francisco. That's closest. It would be very difficult to  check." His curiosity was showing.    "I see. Well, thanks for your time and trouble, Mr. Swanson."    "Not at all. Sorry I couldn't be of more help."    One thing to do. One thing that must be done.    Motors over the mountains. And riding with them, the numb resolve.  Motors over the salt pans, the wheat lands, the corn belt.    The stewardess stops again. "Coffee, sir? A sandwich, perhaps?"    "I beg your-- Oh, no. No, thanks."    She watches him covertly, uneasily, longing for the end of the run.    Motors in the night.    And the dull determination growing, strengthening.    The airport, baggage, the ancient taxi with the piston slap, and at last  the dark, familiar street.    "Jim, you're back! Oh, Jim, darling. Next time they send you west I'm  going too. I am!"    "Okay, Jean, sure. Why not?"    "What's the matter, dear? Oh, you're tired, of course. I should have  known. Sit down, Jim. Let me get you a drink."
