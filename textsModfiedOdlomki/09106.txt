 hunters and gun-bearers, that he must have seen or heard something. I  looked at his face, and saw that he was staring excitedly towards the  dim edge of the bush beyond the deep green line of mealies. I stared  too, and listened. Presently I heard a soft large sound as though a  giant were gently stretching out his hands and pressing back the ears  of standing corn. Then came a pause, and then, out into the open  majestically stalked the largest elephant I ever saw or ever shall see.  Heavens! what a monster he was; and how the moonlight gleamed upon his  one splendid tusk--for the other was missing--as he stood among the  mealies gently moving his enormous ears to and fro, and testing the  wind with his trunk. While I was still marvelling at his girth, and  speculating upon the weight of that huge tusk, which I swore should be  my tusk before very long, out stepped a second bull and stood beside  him.

They fed in a semicircle,  gradually drawing round towards the hut near my tree, in which the corn
