that if I did so the child’s life should be given to me. Indaba-zimbi  interpreted my words, but I noticed that he would not look on me as  he spoke, but covered his face with his hands and spoke of me as “the  ghost” or the “son of the spirit.” For some reason that I have never  quite understood, the chief consented to the duel. I fancy it was  because he believed me to be more than mortal, and was anxious to see  the last of Bombyane.    “Let them fight,” he said. “Give them assegais and no shields; the child  shall be to him who conquers.”    “Yes! yes!” cried the soldiers. “Let them fight.

I will make it all right.”    As I had not the slightest intention of commencing the fray, I thought  this good advice, though how Indaba-zimbi could “make it all right” I  failed to see.    Heavens! how long that half-minute seemed! It happened many years ago,  but the whole scene rises up before my eyes as I write. There behind us
