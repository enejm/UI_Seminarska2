 our queen."    "You are many against one," spoke up Tarzan.  "Why should you not have  your will?  Go your way with La to Opar and if Cadj interferes slay  him."    The priests of Opar welcomed this suggestion with loud cries of  approval.  To them it appeared nothing short of divine inspiration.  The influence of ages of unquestioning obedience to high priests had  made it seem impossible to them to question his authority; but when  they realized that they could force him to their will they were as  happy as children with new toys.    They rushed forward and seized Cadj.  They talked in loud menacing  tones into his ear.

But a few marches to the north Lady Greystoke looked forward to the day
