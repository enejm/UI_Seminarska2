yellow house that was surrounded by a yellow picket fence, so he walked  toward this house and on entering the yard found a Winkie woman picking  up sticks with which to build a fire to cook her morning meal.    "For goodness sake!" she exclaimed on seeing the Frogman.  "What are  you doing out of your frog-pond?"    "I am traveling in search of a jeweled gold dishpan, my good woman," he  replied with an air of great dignity.    "You won't find it here, then," said she.  "Our dishpans are tin, and  they're good enough for anybody.  So go back to your pond and leave me  alone."  She spoke rather crossly and with a lack of respect that  greatly annoyed the Frogman.    "Allow me to tell you, madam," said he, "that although I am a frog, I  am the Greatest and Wisest Frog in all the world.  I may add that I  possess much more wisdom than any Winkie--man or woman--in this land.  Wherever I go, people fall on their knees before me and render homage  to the Great Frogman!  No one else knows so much as I; no one else is  so grand, so magnificent!"    "If you know so much," she retorted, "why don't you know where your  dishpan is instead of chasing around the country after it?"    "Presently," he answered, "I am going where it is, but just now I am  traveling and have had no breakfast.  Therefore I honor you by asking  you for something to eat."    "Oho!  The Great Frogman is hungry as any tramp, is he?  Then pick up  these sticks and help me to build the fire," said the woman  contemptuously.    "Me!   The Great Frogman pick up sticks?" he exclaimed in horror.  "In  the Yip Country where I am more honored and powerful than any King  could be, people weep with joy when I ask them to feed me."    "Then that's the place to go for your breakfast," declared the woman.    "I fear you do not realize my importance," urged the Frogman.  "Exceeding wisdom renders me superior to menial duties."
