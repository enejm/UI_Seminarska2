crippled body over to the instrument enclosure. Dixon staggered toward  it as fast as his half-paralyzed muscles would permit.    He was just too late. The Centaurian jerked a lever home a fraction of  a second before Dixon's smashing ax forever ended his activities. The  lever's action upon the pen of inert hybrids was immediate.    The sweeping lances of light vanished in a brief sheet of vivid flame  which kindled the dark globes on the hybrids' gruesome heads to steady  opalescence--and the dread horde came to life! Sprawling from the pen,  they came scuttling toward Dixon in a surging flood--a scene out of a  nightmare.    Dixon faced the oncoming horde in numb despair, knowing that his  nearly-paralyzed body had no chance in flight.
