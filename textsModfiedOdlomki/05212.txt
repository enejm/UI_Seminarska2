 every major subject, well fitting his brain for the position it holds.  All this, gathered here in one! The five outstanding intellects of  Earth, here gathered in one priceless instrument! Here are my advisors;  here my trusty, never-tiring assistants. I can have their help toward  the solution of any problem; obtain from their individual and combined  intelligences even those rare intuitions which I have found almost  always precede brilliant discoveries.    "For they not only retain all they ever knew of science, but they can  _develop_, even as brains in bodies can develop. Their knowledge does  not become outmoded, if they are kept informed of the latest currents of  scientific thought. From old knowledge and new they build their  structures of logic once my command sets them on. Wills of their own  they have none.    "I have not succeeded in all my secondary alterations, however. For one  thing, I have been unable to deprive them altogether of the memory of  what they formerly were; but it is a subdued memory, to them doubtless  like a dream, familiar yet puzzling. Because of this I imagine they hate  me--heartily!--yet they lack the will, the egocentricity which would  enable them to refuse to answer my questions and do my work.    "Frankly, without them this whole structure"--his hands swept out  widely--"my whole asteroidal kingdom, would have been impossible. Most  of my problems in constructing it were solved here. And in the future  other problems, far greater, will be solved here!"    *      *      *      *      *    Hawk Carse by now understood very well Dr. Ku Sui's purpose in bringing  M. S. Leithgow to his laboratory, and was already goading his brain in  search of a way out. Death was by all means preferable to what the  Eurasian intended--death self-inflicted, and death that mutilated the  brain--but there were no present chances that his searching mind could  see.    If Leithgow suspected what was in store, his face gave no sign of it. He
