suppress the story, if you should get it out somehow. And if you give me  any more trouble at all, I'll see to it that you--stop."    "Murder?"    "Or commitment to an asylum. I can arrange that too."    Fraser sighed. He felt oddly unexcited, empty, as if the interview had  drained him of his last will to resist. He held the pipe loosely in his  fingers, letting it go out.    "Ask me a favor," urged Kennedy. "I'll do it, if it won't harm my own  program. I tell you, I want to square things."    "Well--"    "Think about it. Let me know."    "All right." Fraser got up. "I may do that." He went out the door  without saying goodnight.          4      He sat with his feet on the table, chair tilted back and teetering  dangerously, hands clasped behind his head, pipe filling the room with  blue fog. It was his usual posture for attacking a problem.    And damn it, he thought wearily, this was a question such as he made his  living on. An industrial engineer comes into the office. We want this  and that--a machine for a very special purpose, let's say. What should  we do, Mr. Fraser? Fraser prowls around the plant, reads up on the  industry, and then sits down and thinks. The elements of the problem are  such-and-such; how can they be combined to yield a solution?    Normally, he uses the mathematical approach, especially in machine  design. Most practicing-engineers have a pathetic math background--they  use ten pages of elaborate algebra and rusty calculus to figure out  something that three vector equations would solve. But you have to get  the logical basics straight first, before you can set up your equations.    All right, what is the problem? To get Judy back. That means forcing  Kennedy to restore her normal emotional reactions--no, he didn't want  her thrust into love of him; he just wanted her as she had been.    What are the elements of the problem? Kennedy acts outside the law, but  he has blocked all official channels. He even has connections extending
