 all cost, for if once it went beneath it would be useless. Also I was  desperately afraid of being seen in the lightning flashes, although to  minimise this risk I had kept my dark-coloured cloth hat upon my head.  Lastly there was the lightning itself to fear, for it was fearful and  continuous and seemed to be striking along the water. It was a fact that  a fire-ball or something of the sort hit the surface within a few yards  of me, as though it had aimed at the rifle-barrel and just missed. Or so  I thought, though it may have been a crocodile rising at the moment.    In one way, or rather, in two, however, I was lucky. The first was the  complete absence of wind which must have raised waves that might have  swamped me and would at any rate have wetted the rifle. The second was  that there was no fear of my losing my path for in the mouth of the cave  I could see the glow of the fires which burned on either side of the  Motomboâ€™s seat. They served the same purpose to me as did the lamp of  the lady called Hero to her lover Leander when he swam the Hellespont  to pay her clandestine visits at night. But he had something pleasant to  look forward to, whereas I----! Still, there was another point in common  between us. Hero, if I remember right, was a priestess of the Greek  goddess of love, whereas the party who waited me was also in a religious  line of business.

I  stood upon my feet on the rock bottom, the water coming up to my breast,  and peered about me, while I rested and worked my left arm, stiff with
