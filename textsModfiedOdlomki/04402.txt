Red was watching out of the corner of his eyes again. "Ever think you  would like to be with a circus? I mean, for good?"    Slim considered, "I guess not. I think I'll be an astronomer like my  Dad. I think he wants me to be."    "Huh! Astronomer!" said Red.    Slim felt the doors of the new, private world closing on him and  astronomy became a thing of dead stars and black, empty space.    He said, placatingly, "A circus _would_ be more fun."    "You're just saying that."    "No, I'm not. I mean it."    Red grew argumentative. "Suppose you had a chance to join the circus  right now. What would you do?"    "I--I--"    "See!" Red affected scornful laughter.    Slim was stung. "I'd join up."    "Go on."    "Try me."    Red whirled at him, strange and intense. "You meant that?

I just thought: Let's give good old Slim a  chance."    The world was strange and glamorous, and Slim said, "Sure thing, Red.  I'm in! What is it, huh, Red? Tell me what it is."    "Figure it out. What's the most important thing in circuses?"    Slim thought desperately. He wanted to give the right answer. Finally,  he said, "Acrobats?"    "Holy Smokes! I wouldn't go five steps to look at acrobats."    "I don't know then."    "Animals, that's what! What's the best side-show? Where are the biggest  crowds? Even in the main rings the best acts are animal acts." There was  no doubt in Red's voice.    "Do you think so?"
