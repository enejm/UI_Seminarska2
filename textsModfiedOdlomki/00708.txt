   Suddenly the blue-green leaves of the trees changed to a purple hue,  and Trot noticed this and said:    "I wonder what made the colors change like that?"    "It's because we have left the Munchkin Country and entered the  Gillikin Country," explained the Glass Cat.  "Also it's a sign our  journey is nearly ended."    The river made a sudden turn, and after the travelers had passed around  the bend, they saw that the stream had now become as broad as a small  lake, and in the center of the Lake they beheld a little island, not  more than fifty feet in extent, either way.  Something glittered in the  middle of this tiny island, and the Glass Cat paused on the bank and  said:    "There is the gold flower-pot containing the Magic Flower, which is  very curious and beautiful.
