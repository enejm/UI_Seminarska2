Chapter Twenty-Two    The Sunken Island      As soon as they had breakfasted the next morning, Glinda and the Wizard  and the three Adepts went down to the shore of the lake and formed a  line with their faces toward the submerged island. All the others came  to watch them, but stood at a respectful distance in the background.    At the right of the Sorceress stood Audah and Aurah, while at the left  stood the Wizard and Aujah.

Stout frames of steel supported the glass of the Dome, and  around one of these frames the Wizard tied the end of a rope.    "I'll go down first," said he, "for while I'm not as spry as Cap'n Bill
