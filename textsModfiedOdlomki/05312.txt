  The watch-beacon began to wink more often through the ranks of  intervening trees as he neared the ranch. Carse was gliding so low  that often branches raked and twisted him in his course. His low  transit allowed one tree to loose great peril upon him.    The tree loomed a black giant in his path. Fifty feet away, he was  swerving to wind around it when he noticed its dark upper branches  a-tremble.
