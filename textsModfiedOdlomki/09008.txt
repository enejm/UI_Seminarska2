         The sun sank in a blaze of glory.  Looking back by the light of  its last rays I saw a single native silhouetted against the red  sky.  He was standing on a mound that we had passed a mile or  more behind us, doubtless waiting for his companions whom he had  outrun.  So they had not given up the chase.  What was to be  done?  Once it was completely dark we could not go on.  We should  lose our way; the horses would get into ant-bear holes and break  their legs.  Perhaps we might become bogged in some hollow,  therefore we must wait till the moon rose, which would not be for  a couple of hours.    Meanwhile those accursed Basutos would be following us even in  the dark.  This would hamper them, no doubt, but they would keep  the path, with which they were probably familiar, beneath their  feet, and what is more, the ground being soft with recent rain,  they could feel the wheel spoor with their fingers.  I looked  about me.  Just here another track started off in a nor'-westerly  direction from that which we were following.  Perhaps it ran to  Lydenburg; I do not know.  To our left, not more than a hundred  yards or so away, the higher veld came to an end and sloped in an  easterly direction down to bush-land below.    Should I take the westerly road which ran over a great plain?  No, for then we might be seen for miles and cut off.  Moreover,  even if we escaped the natives, was it desirable we should plunge  into civilization just now and tell all our story, as in that  case we must do.  Rodd's death was quite justified, but it had  happened on Transvaal territory and would require a deal of  explanation.  Fortunately there was no witness of it, except  ourselves.  Yes, there was though--the driver Footsack, if he had  got away, which, being mounted, would seem probable, a man who,  for my part, I would not trust for a moment.  It would be an ugly
