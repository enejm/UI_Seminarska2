who, with his face bedewed with perspiration, felt almost on the point  of fainting. “To whom have you sold this department, Monsieur Fouquet?”  inquired the king.    Colbert was obliged to lean against a column of the fireplace. “To a  councilor belonging to the parliament, sire, whose name is Vanel.”    “Vanel?”    “Yes, sire, a particular friend of the intendant Colbert,” added  Fouquet; letting every word fall from his lips with the most inimitable  nonchalance, and with an admirably assumed expression of forgetfulness  and ignorance. And having finished, and having overwhelmed Colbert  beneath the weight of this superiority, the superintendent again saluted  the king and quitted the room, partially revenged by the stupefaction of  the king and the humiliation of the favorite.    “Is it really possible,” said the king, as soon as Fouquet had  disappeared, “that he has sold that office?”    “Yes, sire,” said Colbert, meaningly.    “He must be mad,” the king added.    Colbert this time did not reply; he had penetrated the king’s thought,  a thought which amply revenged him for the humiliation he had just been  made to suffer; his hatred was augmented by a feeling of bitter jealousy  of Fouquet; and a threat of disgrace was now added to the plan he had  arranged for his ruin. Colbert felt perfectly assured that for the  future, between Louis XIV. and himself, their hostile feelings and ideas  would meet with no obstacles, and that at the first fault committed by  Fouquet, which could be laid hold of as a pretext, the chastisement  so long impending would be precipitated. Fouquet had thrown aside his  weapons of defense, and hate and jealousy had picked them up. Colbert  was invited by the king to the _fete_ at Vaux; he bowed like a man  confident in himself, and accepted the invitation with the air of  one who almost confers a favor. The king was about writing down  Saint-Aignan’s name on his list of royal commands, when the usher  announced the Comte de Saint-Aignan. As soon as the royal “Mercury”  entered, Colbert discreetly withdrew.        Chapter LVII. Rivals in Love.
