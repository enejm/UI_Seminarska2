killed in the struggle?  Were they taken prisoners by the Sioux?  It  was impossible to tell.    There were many wounded, but none mortally.  Colonel Proctor was one of  the most seriously hurt; he had fought bravely, and a ball had entered  his groin.  He was carried into the station with the other wounded  passengers, to receive such attention as could be of avail.    Aouda was safe; and Phileas Fogg, who had been in the thickest of the  fight, had not received a scratch.  Fix was slightly wounded in the  arm.  But Passepartout was not to be found, and tears coursed down  Aouda's cheeks.    All the passengers had got out of the train, the wheels of which were  stained with blood.  From the tyres and spokes hung ragged pieces of  flesh.  As far as the eye could reach on the white plain behind, red  trails were visible.  The last Sioux were disappearing in the south,  along the banks of Republican River.    Mr. Fogg, with folded arms, remained motionless.  He had a serious  decision to make.  Aouda, standing near him, looked at him without  speaking, and he understood her look.  If his servant was a prisoner,  ought he not to risk everything to rescue him from the Indians?  "I  will find him, living or dead," said he quietly to Aouda.    "Ah, Mr.--Mr. Fogg!" cried she, clasping his hands and covering them  with tears.    "Living," added Mr. Fogg, "if we do not lose a moment."    Phileas Fogg, by this resolution, inevitably sacrificed himself; he  pronounced his own doom.  The delay of a single day would make him lose  the steamer at New York, and his bet would be certainly lost.  But as  he thought, "It is my duty," he did not hesitate.    The commanding officer of Fort Kearney was there.  A hundred of his  soldiers had placed themselves in a position to defend the station,  should the Sioux attack it.    "Sir," said Mr. Fogg to the captain, "three passengers have  disappeared."    "Dead?" asked the captain.
