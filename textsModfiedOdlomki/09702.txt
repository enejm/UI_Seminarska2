which I had lost.  He led me into the Wonder House, and by his talk  emboldened me to speak to the Keeper of the Images, so that I was  cheered and made strong.  And when I was faint with hunger he begged  for me, as would a chela for his teacher.  Suddenly was he sent.  Suddenly has he gone away.  It was in my mind to have taught him the  Law upon the road to Benares.'    Kim stood amazed at this, because he had overheard the talk in the  Museum, and knew that the old man was speaking the truth, which is a  thing a native on the road seldom presents to a stranger.    'But I see now that he was but sent for a purpose.  By this I know that  I shall find a certain River for which I seek.'    'The River of the Arrow?'  said Kim, with a superior smile.    'Is this yet another Sending?'  cried the lama.  'To none have I spoken  of my search, save to the Priest of the Images.  Who art thou?'    'Thy chela,' said Kim simply, sitting on his heels.  'I have never seen  anyone like to thee in all this my life.  I go with thee to Benares.  And, too, I think that so old a man as thou, speaking the truth to  chance-met people at dusk, is in great need of a disciple.'    'But the River--the River of the Arrow?'    'Oh, that I heard when thou wast speaking to the Englishman.  I lay  against the door.'    The lama sighed.  'I thought thou hadst been a guide permitted. Such  things fall sometimes--but I am not worthy.  Thou dost not, then, know  the River?'    'Not I,' Kim laughed uneasily.  'I go to look for--for a bull--a Red.  Bull on a green field who shall help me.'  Boylike, if an acquaintance  had a scheme, Kim was quite ready with one of his own; and, boylike, he  had really thought for as much as twenty minutes at a time of his  father's prophecy.
