The glass city had several fine streets, for a good many people lived  there; but when the procession had passed through these it came upon a  broad plain covered with gardens and watered by many pretty brooks that  flowed through it. There were paths through these gardens, and over some  of the brooks were ornamental glass bridges.

"It's violet," said the Wizard, who was in the buggy.    "Now it's blue," complained the horse. "As a matter of fact, I'm eating
