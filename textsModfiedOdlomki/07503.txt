  “I want to know what crime I have committed--to be tried; and if I am  guilty, to be shot; if innocent, to be set at liberty.”    “Are you well fed?” said the inspector.    “I believe so; I don’t know; it’s of no consequence. What matters  really, not only to me, but to officers of justice and the king, is that  an innocent man should languish in prison, the victim of an infamous  denunciation, to die here cursing his executioners.”    “You are very humble today,” remarked the governor; “you are not so  always; the other day, for instance, when you tried to kill the  turnkey.”    “It is true, sir, and I beg his pardon, for he has always been very good  to me, but I was mad.”    “And you are not so any longer?”    “No; captivity has subdued me--I have been here so long.”    “So long?--when were you arrested, then?” asked the inspector.    “The 28th of February, 1815, at half-past two in the afternoon.”    “Today is the 30th of July, 1816,--why it is but seventeen months.”    “Only seventeen months,” replied Dantès. “Oh, you do not know what is  seventeen months in prison!--seventeen ages rather, especially to a man  who, like me, had arrived at the summit of his ambition--to a man, who,  like me, was on the point of marrying a woman he adored, who saw an  honorable career opened before him, and who loses all in an instant--who  sees his prospects destroyed, and is ignorant of the fate of his  affianced wife, and whether his aged father be still living! Seventeen  months’ captivity to a sailor accustomed to the boundless ocean, is a  worse punishment than human crime ever merited. Have pity on me, then,  and ask for me, not intelligence, but a trial; not pardon, but a  verdict--a trial, sir, I ask only for a trial; that, surely, cannot be  denied to one who is accused!”    “We shall see,” said the inspector; then, turning to the governor, “On  my word, the poor devil touches me. You must show me the proofs against  him.”
