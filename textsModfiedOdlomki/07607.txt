  “Ah, ah!” said Porthos, “it appears there’s something fresh here.”    “Yes, we are going--” said Aramis.    “To what country?” demanded Porthos.    “My faith! I don’t know much about it,” said Athos. “Ask d’Artagnan.”    “To London, gentlemen,” said d’Artagnan.    “To London!” cried Porthos; “and what the devil are we going to do in  London?”    “That is what I am not at liberty to tell you, gentlemen; you must trust  to me.”    “But in order to go to London,” added Porthos, “money is needed, and I  have none.”    “Nor I,” said Aramis.    “Nor I,” said Athos.    “I have,” replied d’Artagnan, pulling out his treasure from his pocket,  and placing it on the table. “There are in this bag three hundred  pistoles. Let each take seventy-five; that is enough to take us to  London and back. Besides, make yourselves easy; we shall not all arrive  at London.”    “Why so?”    “Because, in all probability, some one of us will be left on the road.”    “Is this, then, a campaign upon which we are now entering?”    “One of a most dangerous kind, I give you notice.”    “Ah! But if we do risk being killed,” said Porthos, “at least I should  like to know what for.”    “You would be all the wiser,” said Athos.    “And yet,” said Aramis, “I am somewhat of Porthos’s opinion.”    “Is the king accustomed to give you such reasons? No. He says to you  jauntily, ‘Gentlemen, there is fighting going on in Gascony or in  Flanders; go and fight,’ and you go there. Why? You need give yourselves  no more uneasiness about this.”    “d’Artagnan is right,” said Athos; “here are our three leaves of absence  which came from Monsieur de Treville, and here are three hundred  pistoles which came from I don’t know where. So let us go and get killed  where we are told to go. Is life worth the trouble of so many questions?  D’Artagnan, I am ready to follow you.”    “And I also,” said Porthos.
