  Evin produced a key and opened the door to the shack. There was a  partition separating the place neatly into two sections. There were a  couple of straight-backed wooden chairs and a leather sofa in the near  room. The door to the other room was closed.    "Sit down, Muldoon," Robert Reeger said.
