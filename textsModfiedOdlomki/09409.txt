ancient white seal that opens all doors, and I will only make a pretence  of blinding you. Moreover I will cut your cords nearly through, so  that when the night comes you can break them, roll into the river and  escape.’    “‘Take it if you can,’ he said, ‘and use it to injure or destroy that  accursed one.’”    “So you took it, Bes.”    “Yes, Master, but not easily. Remember, it was on a chain about the  man’s neck, and I could not draw it over his head, for, like his hands,  his throat was tied by a cord, as you remember yours was.”    “I remember very well,” I said, “for my throat is still sore from the  rope that ran to the same staples to which my hands were fastened.”    “Yes, Master, and therefore if I drew the chain off his neck, it would  still have been on the ropes.
