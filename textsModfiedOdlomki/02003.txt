Thither all those who had opposed the establishment of the World  Federation, together with all persons convicted for the fourth time of  a felony, had been transported, to superintend the efforts of these  dumb, unhuman Moon dwellers. For it had been discovered that the Moon  craters were extraordinarily rich in gold, and gold was still the  medium of exchange on Earth.    To supplement the vestigial atmosphere, huge stations had been set up,  which extracted the oxygen from the subterranean waters five miles  below the Moon's crust, and recombined it with the nitrogen with  which the surface layer was impregnated, thus creating an atmosphere  which was pumped to the workers.    Then a curious discovery had been made. It was impossible for human  beings to exist without the addition of those elements existing in the  air in minute quantities--neon, krypton, and argon. And the ships that  brought the gold bars back from the Moon had conveyed these gaseous  elements there.    *       *       *       *       *    The droning of the sixteen atomic motors grew louder, and mingled with  the hum of gyroscopes. The ladder was drawn up and the port hole  sealed. On the enclosed bridge Nat threw the switch of durobronze that  released the non-conducting shutter which gave play to the sixteen  great magnets. Swiftly the great ship shot forward into the air. The  droning of the motors became a shrill whine, and then, growing too  shrill for human ears to follow it, gave place to silence.    Nat set the speed lever to five hundred miles an hour, the utmost that  had been found possible in passing through the earth's atmosphere,  owing to the resistance, which tended to heat the vessel and damage  the delicate atomic engines. As soon as the ether was reached, the  speed would be increased to ten or twelve thousand. That meant a  twenty-two hour run to the Moon Colony--about the time usually taken.    He pressed a lever, which set bells ringing in all parts of the ship.
