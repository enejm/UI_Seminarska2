Drilgo stumbled and fell headlong with a howl of terror. But  headlong--inside.    What happened was practically instantaneous. A sudden whir of the  mechanism, a violet glow from the funnel, the smell of chlorine--a  flash of blinding blue-white light. The Atlantean guards had fired--a  quarter-second too late!    The thump, thump of the electrical discharge died away. The four were  in the boat, whirling away through space. Cain was rising to his  knees, a woe-begone expression on his face.
