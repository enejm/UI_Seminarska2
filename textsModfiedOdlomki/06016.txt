I didn't like the methods their manner implied. Copperd looked worried.    "I told you we were a peaceful people," I put in.    "Let me handle this," Ristal said. He pointed to a machine which stood  in a corner.    "That," he explained to Copperd, "is a device which we ordinarily use in  surgery and diagnosis. It has the faculty of making the nerves  infinitely more sensitive to stimuli. Also to pain. Do you understand?"    "You can't use that on him!" I said. Ristal looked at me strangely.    "Of course not. But on his daughter, yes. No father likes to see his  daughter suffer."    "That's out," I said flatly. "You know what our orders are."    "I know what they were. This is my own idea, Marko. Please remember that  I am commander here."    I was duty bound to obey him, and I thought that I _was_ going to obey.  But as Kresh stepped toward Beth I found myself between them.    "I think that those higher up may have something to say about this," I  told Ristal.    "With the information this man can give me I shall be in a position to  ignore those higher up," Ristal grinned.    Kresh reached for Beth and I hit him. I knew now what Ristal had in  mind. With atomic weapons he could make himself master of Venus, and of  Earth. But even more important than that was the thought that he must  not harm Beth.    *       *       *       *       *    Kresh was coming back at me. I hit him again and he went down. Then the  others came piling in. There were four of them, too many for me. I  fought like a madman but they overwhelmed me and held me helpless.    "Give him a shot of _bental_," Ristal ordered. "That ought to quiet him.  Then dump him in a cabin. We'll dispose of him later."
