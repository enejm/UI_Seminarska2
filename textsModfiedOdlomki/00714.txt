   "I'm the Lonesome Duck," replied the bird.  "I suppose you've heard of  me?"    "No," said Trot, "I can't say I have.  What makes you lonesome?"    "Why, I haven't any family or any relations," returned the Duck.    "Haven't you any friends?"    "Not a friend.  And I've nothing to do.  I've lived a long time, and  I've got to live forever, because I belong in the Land of Oz, where no  living thing dies.  Think of existing year after year, with no friends,  no family, and nothing to do!  Can you wonder I'm lonesome?"

"I can't say I like it, exactly," replied the Duck, "but since it seems  to be my fate, I'm rather proud of it."    "How do you s'pose a single, solitary Duck happened to be in the Land  of Oz?" asked Trot, wonderingly.    "I used to know the reason, many years ago, but I've quite forgotten
