  "Other worlds! Where are there other worlds?"    "Everywhere. How about the planets? They're worlds just like ours, some  of them. And other stars probably have planets. There's probably  zillions of planets."    Red felt outweighed and outnumbered. He muttered, "You're crazy!"    "All right, then. I'll show you."    "Hey! Where are you going?"    "Down there. I'm going to ask my father. I suppose you'll believe it if  _he_ tells you. I suppose you'll believe a Professor of Astronomy knows  what--"    He had scrambled upright.    Red said, "Hey. You don't want them to see us. We're not supposed to be  here. Do you want them to start asking questions and find out about our  animals?"    "I don't care. You said I was crazy."    "Snitcher! You promised you wouldn't tell."    "I'm _not_ going to tell. But if they find out themselves, it's your  fault, for starting an argument and saying I was crazy."    "I take it back, then," grumbled Red.    "Well, all right. You better."    In a way, Slim was disappointed. He wanted to see the space-ship at  closer quarters. Still, he could not break his vow of secrecy even in  spirit without at least the excuse of personal insult.    Red said, "It's awfully small for a space-ship."    "Sure, because it's probably a scout-ship."    "I'll bet Dad couldn't even get into the old thing."    So much Slim realized to be true. It was a weak point in his argument  and he made no answer. His interest was absorbed by the adults.    Red rose to his feet; an elaborate attitude of boredom all about him.  "Well, I guess we better be going. There's business to do and I can't  spend all day here looking at some old space-ship or whatever it is.  We've got to take care of the animals if we're going to be circus-folks.  That's the first rule with circus-folks. They've got to take care of the  animals. And," he finished virtuously, "that's what I aim to do,  anyway."
