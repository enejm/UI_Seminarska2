within our whole civilization, and will bear it forever. But has she  given us more than that? Are our own selves, bodies and minds and  dreams, are they also the children of Earth?_    Now he was thinking like Kormt, stubborn old Kormt who clung with such a  blind strength to this land simply because it was his.
