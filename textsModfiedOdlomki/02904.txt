 have strode along the street like a determined machine. I reached the  house and let myself into the basement room. Inside, I pulled the shades  together and closed the door, the matchbox still in my hand. No one was  at home this time of day, which pleased me particularly, for I wanted to  figure out how I was going to present this wonder to the world.    I flung myself down on the bed and opened the matchbox. The little man  lay very still on the bottom.    "Little Man!" I cried, and turned him out on the quilt. Maybe he had  suffocated in the box. Irrational thought! Small though it might be to  me, the little box was as big as all outdoors to him. It was the bumping  about he'd endured; I hadn't been very thoughtful of him.    He was reviving now, and raised himself on one arm. I pushed myself off  the bed, and stepped quickly to my table to procure something with which  I could control him. Not that he could get away, but he was so tiny I  thought I might lose sight of him.    Pen, pencil, paper, stamps, scissors, clips--none of them were what I  wanted. I had nothing definite in mind, but then remembered my stamp  outfit and rushed to secure it. Evidently college work had cramped my  style along the collecting line, for the tweezers and magnifier appeared  with a mild coating of dust. But they were what I needed, and I blew on  them and returned to the bed.    The little man had made his way half an inch or so from his former  prison; was crawling over what I suppose were, to him, great uneven  blocks of red and green and black moss.    He crossed from a red into a black patch as I watched his movements  through the glass, and I could see him more plainly against the darker  background. He stopped and picked at the substance of his strange  surroundings, then straightened to examine a tuft of the cloth. The  magnifier enlarged him to a seeming half inch or so, and I could see  better, now, this strange tiny creature.
