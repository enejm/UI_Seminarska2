with rapidly moving vehicles, the roof-tops with air-craft. Then  suddenly the scene darkened; a deep rumbling came from the sea. As  they watched in fascinated wonder, a great chasm opened up through the  heart of the city. Tall buildings swayed and crumbled, falling into  heaps of twisted metal and crushed masonry and burying hundreds of the  populace in their fall. The confusion was indescribable, the uproar  terrific, and within the space of a very few minutes the entire city  was a mass of ruins, fully half of the wrecked area having been  swallowed up by the heaving waters of the ocean.    *       *       *       *       *    Phaestra stifled a sob.

Computations of the scientists  showed that the upheaval was widespread and that the entire continent  was to be engulfed in a very short time. The exodus began, but it was  too late, and only a few hundred people were able to escape the  continent before it was finally destroyed. The ocean became the tomb  of two hundred millions. The handful of survivors reached the coast of  what is now North America. But the rigors of the climate proved severe  and more than three-quarters of them perished within a few days after  their planes landed. Then the rest took to the caves along the shore,  and for a while were safe."    She manipulated the controls once more and there was a quick shift to  another coast, a rugged, wave-beaten shore.
