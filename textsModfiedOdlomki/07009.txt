haltingly she groped for a way to extricate herself from her dilemma.  "I thought--" she faltered, "but no, I am mistaken--I thought that he  was one whom I had seen before near the Kor-ul-GRYF."    The Ho-don looked first at one and then at the other an expression of  doubt and questioning in her eyes. "But you have not answered me," she  continued presently; "who are you?"
