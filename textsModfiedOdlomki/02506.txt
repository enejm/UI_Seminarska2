reported missing.    What followed then, though Von Ullrich masked it in polite words, was  a story of piracy, until they found by degrees that there was more  gold on the bottom of the ocean than the top; and from this to the  discovery of the sunken empire where he now held reign was but a step.    They had thought at first they were looting only empty temples--but,  finding people there, had easily conquered them, though ruling them,  he admitted, was another matter. As, for instance, yesterday, when the  priests had interfered with his orders and carried his three chief  captives off to sacrifice.    "Where now, but for me, you would be food for their gods!" he ended.  "And if you do not find my hospitality altogether to your liking,  friends, remember that you came uninvited. In fact, if you will  recall, you came despite my explicit warning!"    *       *       *       *       *    But since they were here, he told them, they might be willing to repay  his good turn with another.    Whereupon Von Ullrich launched into his proposal, which was that  Professor Stevens place the _Nereid_ at his disposal for visiting the  depths at the foot of the plateau, where lay the capital of the  empire, he said--a magnificent metropolis known as the City of the Sun  and modeled after the great Atlantean capital, the City of the Golden  Gates, and the depository of a treasure, the greedy German believed,  that was the ransom of the world.    The professor frowned, and for a moment Larry thought he was going to  remind their host that this was not a treasure hunt.    "Why," he asked instead, "do you not use your own submarine for the  purpose?"    "Because for one thing, she will not stand the pressure, nor will our  suits," was the reply. "And for another, she is already laden with  treasure, ready for an--er--forced abdication!" with a sardonic laugh.
