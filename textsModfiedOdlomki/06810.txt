 "I was with the Fifth Army last year when the wave swept us. We were  fairly swamped for the moment and all nohow. One evening, retreating  on my own line, I came upon some little village--can't remember the  name just now, but you know the sort of thing--typical Somme hamlet, a  smear of brick-dust with a big notice-board on top, saying, 'THIS IS  LE SARS,' or 'POZIÃˆRES,' or whatever its name was.
