 offered to buy his shares.  But Bones had said he would not under any  circumstances----    "Buy my shares?" said de Vinne quickly.    "Well, he didn't exactly say that," said Fred.  "But he gave me to  understand that he'd rather buy the shares from me than from anybody  else, and I thought it was such an excellent idea, and I could fix it  up with you on the telephone, so I sold him----"    "How many?" wailed de Vinne.    "A hundred and fifty thousand," said Mr. Fred, and the two men stared  at one another.    De Vinne licked his dry lips.    "It comes to this," he said.  "Between us we've sold him three hundred  and thirty thousand shares.  There are only two hundred and fifty  thousand shares issued, so we've got to deliver eighty thousand shares  that are non-existent or be posted as defaulters."    Another long pause, and then both men said simultaneously, as though  the thought had struck them for the first time:    "Why, the fellow's a rogue!"    The next morning they called upon Bones, and they were with him for  half an hour; and when they went, they left behind them, not only the  cheques that Bones had given them, but another cheque for a most  substantial amount as consideration.    That night Bones gave a wonderful dinner-party at the most expensive  hotel in London.  Sanders was there, and Patricia Sanders, and  Hamilton, and a certain Vera, whom the bold Bones called by her  Christian name, but the prettiest of the girls was she who sat on his  right and listened to the delivery of Bones's great speech in fear and  trembling.    "The toast of the evening, dear old friends," said Bones, "is Cupidity  and Cupid.  Coupled with the names of the Honourable de Vinne and my  young and lovely typewriter--my friend and companion in storm and  stress, the only jolly old lady, if I may be allowed to say so, that  has stirred my young heart"--he caught Patricia Sanders's accusing eye,  coughed, and added--"in Europe!"
