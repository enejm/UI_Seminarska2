pounding fists. Slowly the fingers managed to reach their goal. Muldoon  felt the darkness of death closing over him as his breath became a  tortured dying gasp. His hand found Robert's face, came gently over it  until his thumb pressed on one eyeball. And Robert screamed as the thumb  became a hooked instrument to blind him.    Muldoon rolled away from the other, staggered somehow erect, but knew  his strength was gone. He couldn't make it to the door. And now Evin had  him....    And the door burst open and men poured into the room. Muldoon recognized  only one, the head of the Treasury's investigation department, before he  blacked out.    *       *       *       *       *    Deena Savory stroked his forehead gently. "Does it hurt much, baby?"    The nurse had left them alone when Deena came into the hospital room.    "Not now," Muldoon said.    "What are they going to do to those men?" she asked.    "Oh, twenty years, according to Phillips. Counterfeiting, you know,  carries heavy penalties."    "But I thought the money was good? After all, they had paid rent with  C-notes."    "A slip-up on the bank's part. You see they made one mistake. The  machine they had, turned out perfect bills. Every one with the same  serial number...."    Deena's eyes widened.    "And the junk shop or whatever it was?" she said.    "I thought I'd let well enough alone. You see I took care of that during  the day. The twins, being criminals, had automatically broken their  lease. They also made it possible for me to change clients. Well,  there's going to be a huge tank covering that dump and shack, a tank  holding an awful lot of natural gas. I got together with the owner of  the property and the utility people yesterday afternoon and worked out a  deal. They're going to dump all that junk into the ocean."    "I'm sorry about the other night," she said suddenly.
