   They stood discussing the fire for a minute and presently moved off.  Peter gave them two minutes' law and then clambered back to the highway  and set off along it at a run.  The noise of the shelling and the wind,  together with the thick darkness, made it safe to hurry.    He left the road at the first chance and took to the broken country.  The ground was now rising towards a spur of the Palantuken, on the far  slope of which were the Turkish trenches.  The night had begun by being  pretty nearly as black as pitch; even the smoke from the shell  explosions, which is often visible in darkness, could not be seen.  But  as the wind blew the snow-clouds athwart the sky patches of stars came  out.  Peter had a compass, but he didn't need to use it, for he had a  kind of 'feel' for landscape, a special sense which is born in savages  and can only be acquired after long experience by the white man.  I  believe he could smell where the north lay.  He had settled roughly  which part of the line he would try, merely because of its nearness to  the enemy.  But he might see reason to vary this, and as he moved he  began to think that the safest place was where the shelling was  hottest.  He didn't like the notion, but it sounded sense.    Suddenly he began to puzzle over queer things in the ground, and, as he  had never seen big guns before, it took him a moment to fix them.  Presently one went off at his elbow with a roar like the Last Day.  These were Austrian howitzers--nothing over eight-inch, I fancy, but to  Peter they looked like leviathans.  Here, too, he saw for the first  time a big and quite recent shell-hole, for the Russian guns were  searching out the position.  He was so interested in it all that he  poked his nose where he shouldn't have been, and dropped plump into the  pit behind a gun-emplacement.    Gunners all the world over are the same--shy people, who hide  themselves in holes and hibernate and mortally dislike being detected.
