that the Hon. Morison was worthy of his little Meriem.  Slowly he  turned toward a nearby tree.  Leaping upward he caught a lower branch  and drew himself up among the branches.  His movements were cat-like  and agile.  High into the trees he made his way and there commenced to  divest himself of his clothing. From the game bag slung across one  shoulder he drew a long strip of doe-skin, a neatly coiled rope, and a  wicked looking knife.  The doe-skin, he fashioned into a loin cloth,  the rope he looped over one shoulder, and the knife he thrust into the  belt formed by his gee string.
