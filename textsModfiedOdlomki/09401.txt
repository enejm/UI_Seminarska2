Jacobean--I mean, the heavenly--ladder, it is legitimate to inquire why  they show such reluctance in jumping off. As a matter of fact the only  persons that, individually, I have seen quite willing to die, except now  and again to save somebody else whom they were so foolish as to care for  more than they did for themselves, have been not those “upon whom the  light has shined” to quote an earnest paper I chanced to read this  morning, but, to quote again, “the sinful heathen wandering in their  native blackness,” by which I understand the writer to refer to their  moral state and not to their sable skins wherein for the most part they  are also condemned to wander, that is if they happen to have been born  south of a certain degree of latitude.    To come to facts, the staff of Faith which each must shape for himself,  is often hewn from unsuitable kinds of wood, yes, even by the very best  among us. Willow, for instance, is pretty and easy to cut, but try to  support yourself with it on the edge of a precipice and see where you  are. Then of a truth you will long for ironbark, or even homely oak. I  might carry my parable further, some allusions to the proper material  of which to fashion the helmet of Salvation suggest themselves to me for  example, but I won’t.    The truth is that we fear to die because all the religions are full of  uncomfortable hints as to what may happen to us afterwards as a reward  for our deviations from their laws and we half believe in something,  whereas often the savage, not being troubled with religion, fears less,  because he half believes in nothing. For very few inhabitants of this  earth can attain either to complete belief or to its absolute opposite.  They can seldom lay their hands upon their hearts, and say they _know_  that they will live for ever, or sleep for ever; there remains in the  case of most honest men an element of doubt in either hypothesis.    That is what makes this story of mine so interesting, at any rate to  me, since it does seem to suggest that whether or no I have a future,
