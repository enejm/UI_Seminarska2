  *       *       *       *       *    Life on the spaceship seemed to be given over to silent, morose  meditation, with an occasional groan that sounded very much like, "Oh,  give me just one more chance, God."    When they left the ship, it was again by mataform, this time to a  building where they stood in a line of people. The line wound through  a booth where the color of their capes was marked on their foreheads,  thence past a counter where they received strong khaki-colored capes,  blouses and hose, and new leather shorts and boots to replace those  they were wearing. They changed in tiny private rooms, handed their  own clothing in at another counter, had a number stamped on their left  shoulders and on their boxes of clothing.    Then they walked out onto a strip of brilliant white sand, fronting on  an inlet of sparkling blue water.    Here and there huddled little crowded knots of people, dancing from one  foot to another on the hot sand and yet apparently afraid to go in the  water. Dan looked to the Milbuns for some clue and saw them darting  intense calculating glances at the beach and the water.    Then Mr. Milbun yelled, "_Run for it!_"    A slavering sound reached Dan's ear. He sprinted after the Milbuns,  burst through the crowd in a headlong bolt for the cove, then swam as  fast as he could to keep up with them as they raced for the opposite  shore. They crawled out, strangling and gasping, and dragged themselves  up on the sand. Dan lay, heaving in deep breaths, then rolled over and  sat up.    The air around them was split by screams, laced through with sobs,  curses and groans. On the shore opposite, a mad dog darted across  the crowded beach and emptied people into the cove. In the cove, a  glistening black sweep of hide separated the water for an instant, then  sank below. People thrashed, fought and went under.
