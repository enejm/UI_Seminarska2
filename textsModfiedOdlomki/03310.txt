leaving at once for the transcontinental jetport. Just to account  for disappearing, you know. There aren't any Eridanians or Terries  hereabouts, but we desperate characters--" he grinned, briefly--"can't  be too careful. Brought my equipment along, of course. I suppose they  want me to do psychometry on fleet personnel?"    "Something on that order. I don't know."    We made our way through a fine drizzle of rain to the little torpedo of  the spaceboat. I looked around into the misty dark and breathed a deep  lungful of the cool wet wind. And I saw that Barbara was doing the same.    *       *       *       *       *    She smiled up at me through the night and the thin sad rain. "Earth is  a beautiful world, Con," she whispered.

We sent a coded call  signal and got a directional beam from the ship. Before long we were  approaching it.    I studied the lean black cruiser. She seemed to be of about the same  design as the old Solarian interplanetary ships, modified somewhat to  accommodate the star drive. Apparently, she was one of those built  at Main Base. Her bow guns were dark shadows against the clotted  cold silver of the Milky Way.

Fostering  this murderousness was a frightful risk. The main defense against it  was Intelligence, and that depended on agents like myself. Perhaps  _only_ myself.    The crew was rather small, no battles being anticipated. But they were
