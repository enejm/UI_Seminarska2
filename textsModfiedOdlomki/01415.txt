  "Again, please!" called Dr. Bird. "And stop when he faces us full."    The picture was repeated and stopped at the point indicated.    "Lights, please!" cried the doctor.    The lights flashed on and Dr. Bird rose to his feet, pulling up after  him the wilted figure of a middle-aged man.    "Gentlemen," said the doctor in ringing tones, "allow me to present to  you Professor James Kirkwood of the faculty of the Richton University,  formerly known as James Collier of the Bureau of Standards, and robber  of the First National Bank."    Detective-Captain Sturtevant jumped to his feet and cast a searching  glance at the captive.    "He's the man all right," he cried. "Hang on to him until I get a wagon  here!"    "Oh, shut up!" said Carnes. "He's under federal arrest just now, charged  with the possession of narcotics. When we are through with him, you can  have him if you want him."    "How did you get that picture, Doctor?" cried the cashier. "I watched  that cage every minute during the morning and I'll swear that man never  entered and stole that money as the picture shows, unless he managed to  make himself invisible."    *       *       *       *       *    "You're closer to the truth than you suspect, Mr. Rogers," said Dr.  Bird. "It is not quite a matter of invisibility, but something pretty  close to it. It is a matter of catalysts."    "What kind of cats?" asked the cashier.    "Not cats, Mr. Rogers, catalysts. Catalysts is the name of a chemical  reaction consisting essentially of a decomposition and a new combination  effected by means of a catalyst which acts on the compound bodies in  question, but which goes through the reaction itself unchanged. There  are a great many of them which are used in the arts and in  manufacturing, and while their action is not always clearly understood,  the results are well known and can be banked on.
