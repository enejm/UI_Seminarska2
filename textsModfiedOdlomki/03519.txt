  The wind had laid itself, a clear frosty morning glittered on the sea  and the longship was a distant sliver against white-capped blueness. The  minstrel groaned. "What a distance to row! Oh, well--"    *       *       *       *       *    They were at sea before Hildigund spoke. Awe was in the eyes that  watched him. "No man could be so brave," she murmured. "Are ye a god?"    "Not quite," said Cappen. "No, most beautiful one, modesty grips my  tongue. 'Twas but that I had the silver and was therefore proof against  her sorcery."    "But the silver was no help!" she cried.    Cappen's oar caught a crab. "What?" he yelled.    "No--no--why, she told ye so her own self--"    "I thought she lied. I _know_ the silver guards against--"    "But she used no magic! Trolls have but their own strength!"    Cappen sagged in his seat. For a moment he thought he was going to  faint. Then only his lack of fear had armored him; and if he had known  the truth, that would not have lasted a minute.    He laughed shakily. Another score for his doubts about the overall value  of truth!    The longship's oars bit water and approached him. Indignant voices  asking why he had been so long on his errand faded when his passenger  was seen. And Svearek the king wept as he took his daughter back into  his arms.    The hard brown face was still blurred with tears when he looked at the  minstrel, but the return of his old self was there too. "What ye have  done, Cappen Varra of Croy, is what no other man in the world could have  done."    "Aye--aye--" The rough northern voices held adoration as the warriors  crowded around the slim red-haired figure.    "Ye shall have her whom ye saved to wife," said Svearek, "and when I die  ye shall rule all Norren."
