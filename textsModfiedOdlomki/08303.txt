  "This one is a man. Green eyes, streak of white hair over the left ear.  Paints himself like the Red Bones, as you call them, but is a white  man."    "Oh! That one? Heard of him, yes. Wild man of the jungle. Want to catch  him and put him in a circus?"    "Maybe. We'd like to see him, anyhow. Heard about him awhile ago. Any  way to get him that you know of?"    "Might try a steel trap," the German suggested, callously. "But I don't  know where you'd set it. Best way to get a wild dog is to shoot him, and  he isn't much good dead.

"If you will pardon me, I will drink my kümmel. Frankly, I do not like  whisky."    "And frankly, we do not like kümmel. All a matter of taste."    "Truly. So let each of us drink his own preference. I will join you in a
