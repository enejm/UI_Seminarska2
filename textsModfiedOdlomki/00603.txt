followed them he would not tear his splendid clothes. Cayke, too, was  wearing her best dress and was likewise afraid of the thorns and  prickers, so she kept behind the Frogman.    They made rather slow progress and night overtook them before they were  halfway down the mountainside, so they found a cave in which they  sought shelter until morning.  Cayke had brought along a basket full of  her famous cookies, so they all had plenty to eat.  On the second day  the Yips began to wish they had not embarked on this adventure. They  grumbled a good deal at having to cut away the thorns to make the path  for the Frogman and the Cookie Cook, for their own clothing suffered  many tears, while Cayke and the Frogman traveled safely and in comfort.    "If it is true that anyone came to our country to steal your diamond  dishpan," said one of the Yips to Cayke, "it must have been a bird, for  no person in the form of a man, woman or child could have climbed  through these bushes and back again."    "And, allowing he could have done so," said another Yip, "the  diamond-studded gold dishpan would not have repaid him for his troubles  and his tribulations."    "For my part," remarked a third Yip, "I would rather go back home and  dig and polish some more diamonds and mine some more gold and make you  another dishpan than be scratched from head to heel by these dreadful  bushes.  Even now, if my mother saw me, she would not know I am her  son."    Cayke paid no heed to these mutterings, nor did the Frogman.  Although  their journey was slow, it was being made easy for them by the Yips, so  they had nothing to complain of and no desire to turn back.  Quite near  to the bottom of the great hill they came upon a great gulf, the sides  of which were as smooth as glass.  The gulf extended a long  distance--as far as they could see in either direction--and although it  was not very wide, it was far too wide for the Yips to leap across it.
