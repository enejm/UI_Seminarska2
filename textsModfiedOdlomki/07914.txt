   “But, happily, it is the slowest way, is it not?” she replied, as she  led him towards the grove of trees they had so lately quitted.        Chapter XLVI. Aramis’s Correspondence.    When De Guiche’s affairs, which had been suddenly set to right without  his having been able to guess the cause of their improvement, assumed  the unexpected aspect we have seen, Raoul, in obedience to the request  of the princess, had withdrawn in order not to interrupt an explanation,  the results of which he was far from guessing; and he soon after joined  the ladies of honor who were walking about in the flower-gardens. During  this time, the Chevalier de Lorraine, who had returned to his own room,  read De Wardes’s latter with surprise, for it informed him by the hand  of his valet, of the sword-thrust received at Calais, and of all the  details of the adventure, and invited him to inform De Guiche and  Monsieur, whatever there might be in the affair likely to be most  disagreeable to both of them. De Wardes particularly endeavored to prove  to the chevalier the violence of Madame’s affection for Buckingham, and  he finished his letter by declaring that he thought this feeling was  returned. The chevalier shrugged his shoulders at the last paragraph,  and, in fact, De Wardes was out of date, as we have seen. De Wardes was  still only at Buckingham’s affair. The chevalier threw the letter over  his shoulder upon an adjoining table, and said in a disdainful tone,  “It is really incredible; and yet poor De Wardes is not deficient in  ability; but the truth is, it is not very apparent, so easy is it to  grow rusty in the country. The deuce take the simpleton, who ought to  have written to me about matters of importance, and yet he writes such  silly stuff as that. If it had not been for that miserable letter, which  has no meaning at all in it, I should have detected in the grove yonder  a charming little intrigue, which would have compromised a woman, would  have perhaps have been as good as a sword-thrust for a man, and have  diverted Monsieur for many days to come.”
