  Happily for the brothers, they did not understand this at the time or  they would surely have gone back to be buried in their own clay.    "I think," the governor told them, "that you gentlemen have not  paused to consider the affair from all angles. You must learn to be  modern--keep up with the times! We heads of government on Zur are doing  all in our power to aid the Earthmen and facilitate their bringing a  great, new culture that can only benefit us. See how Zur has changed in  ten short years! Imagine the world of tomorrow! Why, do you know they  are even bringing _autos_ to Zur!"    The brothers were fascinated with the governor's description of these  hitherto unheard-of vehicles.    "It only remains," concluded the governor, "to build highways, and the  Earthmen are taking care of that."    At any rate, the brothers Masur were still able to console themselves  that they had their tile business. Tile served well enough for houses  and street surfacing; what better material could be devised for the new  highways the governor spoke of? There was a lot of money to be made  yet.    *       *       *       *       *    Radio stations went up all over Zur and began broadcasting. The people  bought receiving sets like mad. The automobiles arrived and highways  were constructed.    The last hope of the brothers was dashed. The Earthmen set up plants  and began to manufacture Portland cement.    You could build a house of concrete much cheaper than with tile. Of  course, since wood was scarce on Zur, it was no competition for either  tile or concrete. Concrete floors were smoother, too, and the stuff  made far better road surfacing.    The demand for Masur tile hit rock bottom.    The next time the brothers went to see the governor, he said, "I cannot  handle such complaints as yours. I must refer you to the Merchandising  Council."
