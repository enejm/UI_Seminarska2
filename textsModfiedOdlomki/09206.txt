 her ambitions. She asked me for my advice as to Saduko. On this point  I replied to her that, if she loved him, and her father would allow it,  presumably she had better marry him.    “I like him well enough, Macumazahn, although he wearies me at times;  but love-- Oh, tell me, _what_ is love?” Then she clasped her slim hands  and gazed at me like a fawn.    “Upon my word, young woman,” I replied, “that is a matter upon which I  should have thought you more competent to instruct me.”    “Oh, Macumazahn,” she said almost in a whisper, and letting her head  droop like a fading lily, “you have never given me the chance, have  you?” And she laughed a little, looking extremely attractive.    “Good gracious!”--or, rather, its Zulu equivalent--I answered, for I  began to feel nervous. “What do you mean, Mameena? How could I--” There  I stopped.    “I do not know what I mean, Macumazahn,” she exclaimed wildly, “but  I know well enough what you mean--that you are white as snow and I am  black as soot, and that snow and soot don’t mix well together.”    “No,” I answered gravely, “snow is good to look at, and so is soot, but  mingled they make an ugly colour. Not that you are like soot,” I added  hastily, fearing to hurt her feelings. “That is your hue”--and I touched  a copper bangle she was wearing--“a very lovely hue, Mameena, like  everything else about you.”    “Lovely,” she said, beginning to weep a little, which upset me very  much, for if there is one thing I hate, it is to see a woman cry. “How  can a poor Zulu girl be lovely? Oh, Macumazahn, the spirits have dealt  hardly with me, who have given me the colour of my people and the  heart of yours. If I were white, now, what you are pleased to call this  loveliness of mine would be of some use to me, for then-- then-- Oh,  cannot you guess, Macumazahn?”    I shook my head and said that I could not, and next moment was sorry,  for she proceeded to explain.
