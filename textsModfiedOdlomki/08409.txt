for the regiments, and a curious horseshoe-shaped hill, with which we  were destined to become better acquainted, about two miles to the  north. It is beautifully situated, and through the centre of the kraal,  dividing it into two portions, runs a river, which appeared to be  bridged in several places, the same indeed that we had seen from the  slopes of Sheba's Breasts. Sixty or seventy miles away three great  snow-capped mountains, placed at the points of a triangle, started out  of the level plain. The conformation of these mountains is unlike that  of Sheba's Breasts, being sheer and precipitous, instead of smooth and  rounded.    Infadoos saw us looking at them, and volunteered a remark.    "The road ends there," he said, pointing to the mountains known among  the Kukuanas as the "Three Witches."    "Why does it end?" I asked.

"There are Solomon's diamond mines," I said.    Umbopa was standing with them, apparently plunged in one of the fits of
