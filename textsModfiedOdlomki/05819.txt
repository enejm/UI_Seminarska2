outposts?"    Reiss grinned. "That's right. They look awful good after a year or two  in space."    "Make that twenty-five by Zen standards or three thousand by ours," said  Joe Hargraves, "and I'll bet they look beautiful to each other."    We decided to drop our investigation of Vesta for the time being, and  come back to it after the honeymoon.    Six months later, when we returned, there were twelve hundred Zen on  Vesta!    Captain Feldman was a realist but he was also a deeply moral man. He  went to Yurt and said, "It's indecent! Couldn't the two of you control  yourselves at least a little? _Twelve hundred kids!_"    "We were rather surprised ourselves," Yurt said complacently. "But this  seems to be how Zen reproduce. Can you have only half a child?"    Naturally, Feld got the authorities to quarantine Vesta. Good God, the  Zen could push us clear out of the Solar System in a couple of  generations!    I don't think they would, but you can't take such chances, can you?    --JEROME BIXBY          Transcriber's Note:    This etext was produced from _Galaxy Science Fiction_ October 1952.
