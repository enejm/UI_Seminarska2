  The questions were swept away by the necessity for action. Snap was  rigging the hand-compressors. If he could get the pressure back in the  tanks....    I swung on Coniston. "You armed?"    "Yes." He was white-faced and confused, but not in a panic. He showed me  his heat-ray cylinder. "What do you want me to do?"    "Round up the crew. Get all you can. Bring them here to man these  pumps."    He dashed away. Snap shouted after him. "Kill them down if they argue!"    Miko's voice sounded from the turret call grid: "Falling! Haljan, you  can see it now! Check us!"    I did not answer that. I pumped with Snap.    Desperate moments. Or was it an hour? Coniston brought the men. He stood  over them with menacing weapon.    We had all the pumps going. The pressure rose a little in the tanks.  Enough to shift a bow-plate. I tried it. The plate slowly clicked into a  new combination. A gravity repulsion just in the bow-tip.    *       *       *       *       *    I signaled Miko. "Have we stopped swinging?"    "No. But slower."    I could feel it, that lurch of the gravity. But not steady now. A limp.  The tendency of our bow was to stay up.    "More pressure, Snap."    "Yes."    One of the crew rebelled, tried to bolt from the room. "God, we'll  crash, caught in here!"    Coniston shot him down.    I shifted another bow-plate. Then two in the stern. The stern-plates  seemed to move more readily than the others.    "Run all the stern-plates," Snap advised.    I tried it. The lurching stopped. Miko called. "We're bow down.  Falling!"    But not falling free. The Moon-gravity pull upon us was more than half  neutralized.    "I'll go up, Snap, and try the engines. You don't mind staying down?
