  He may be correct, the observer who says  Henceforth there'll be many a rover  Ambitious to go, in American phrase,  To the edge of beyond and some over;  But I, for my part, harbour other designs;  My wanderlust's wholly abated;  With travel on even luxurious lines  I'm more than sufficiently sated.    Having roamed into Egypt, according to plan,  Along with my fellows (a merry Co.),  Having carried a pack from Beersheba to Dan  And footslogged from Gaza to Jericho,  I'll not seek a fresh inaccessible spot  In order to slaughter a new brute;  To me inaccessible's anywhere not  To be found on a regular tube route.    For barbarous jungles or desolate streams  I don't give a tuppenny damlet;  For, candidly, London revisited seems  A very endurable hamlet;  Though others may find her excitements too mild  And sigh for things gladder or madder,  I'm fully resolved that the call of the wild  Shall find me as deaf as an adder.    *       *       *       *       *    "Trouser maker wanted; constant."--_Jewish Chronicle_.
