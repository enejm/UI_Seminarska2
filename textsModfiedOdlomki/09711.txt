camping-ground for spite,' Mahbub confided to Kim as the boy filled his  pipe under a tree, 'I did not know how greatly they were fools, and  this made me wroth.  As thus--,' and he told Kim a tale of an  expression, misused in all innocence, that doubled Kim up with mirth.  'Now I see, however,'--he exhaled smoke slowly--'that it is with them  as with all men--in certain matters they are wise, and in others most  foolish.  Very foolish it is to use the wrong word to a stranger; for  though the heart may be clean of offence, how is the stranger to know  that?  He is more like to search truth with a dagger.'    'True.  True talk,' said Kim solemnly.  'Fools speak of a cat when a  woman is brought to bed, for instance.  I have heard them.'    'Therefore, in one situate as thou art, it particularly behoves thee to  remember this with both kinds of faces.  Among Sahibs, never forgetting  thou art a Sahib; among the folk of Hind, always remembering thou  art--' He paused, with a puzzled smile.    'What am I? Mussalman, Hindu, Jain, or Buddhist?  That is a hard knot.'    'Thou art beyond question an unbeliever, and therefore thou wilt be  damned.  So says my Law--or I think it does.  But thou art also my  Little Friend of all the World, and I love thee.  So says my heart.  This matter of creeds is like horseflesh.  The wise man knows horses  are good--that there is a profit to be made from all; and for  myself--but that I am a good Sunni and hate the men of Tirah--I could  believe the same of all the Faiths.  Now manifestly a Kathiawar mare  taken from the sands of her birthplace and removed to the west of  Bengal founders--nor is even a Balkh stallion (and there are no better  horses than those of Balkh, were they not so heavy in the shoulder) of  any account in the great Northern deserts beside the snow-camels I have  seen.  Therefore I say in my heart the Faiths are like the horses.  Each has merit in its own country.'
