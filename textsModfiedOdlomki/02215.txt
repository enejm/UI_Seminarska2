"Philip, run away! They want to catch you! De Boer, the bandit, is  coming!"    "I know it!"    Fool that I was, to pause with talk! There was no time: I must get  Jetta out of here. Break down this door.    But it would not yield. A gas torch would melt this outer seal. Was  there a torch here at Spawn's? But I had no time to search for a  torch! Or a bar with which to ram this door--    A panic seized me, with the fresh realization that any instant De Boer  and his men would arrive. I beat with futile fists on the door, and  Jetta from within, calling to me to get away before I was caught.    This accursed door between us!    *       *       *       *       *    And then--after no more than half a minute, doubtless--I thought of  the window. My momentary panic left me. I dashed to the window oval.  Sealed. But the shutter curtain, and the glassite pane behind it, were  fragile.    "Jetta, are you near the window?"    "No. On the bed. They have tied me."    "Look out; I'm breaking through!"    There were loose rocks, as large as my head, set to mark the garden  path. I seized one and hurled it. With a crash it went through the  window and fell to the floor of the room. A jagged hole showed.    "All right, Jetta?"    "Yes! Yes, Philip."    I squirmed through the oval and dropped to the floor. My arms were cut  from the jagged glassite, though I did not know it then. It was dim  inside the room, but I could see the outline of the bed with her lying  on it.    Her ankles and wrists were tied. I cut the cords with my knife.    She was gasping. "They're planning to capture you. Philip! You should  not be here! Get away!"
