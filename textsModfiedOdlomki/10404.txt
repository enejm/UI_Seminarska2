and all that sort of thing, and my sister, who has an awfully keen sense  of humour, would dearly love to see you at the helm of the _Wiggle_, but  as the Commissioner wants to make a holiday, I think it would be best if  you left the steering to one of the boys."    Bones drew himself up stiffly.    "Dear old officer," he said aggrieved, "I cannot think that you wish to  speak disparagingly of my intelligence----"    "Get that silly idea out of your head," said Hamilton. "That is just  what I'm trying to do."    "I'm under your jolly old orders, sir," Bones said with the air of an  early Christian martyr, "and according to Paragraph 156 of King's  Regulations----"    "Don't let us go into that," said Hamilton. "I'm not giving you any  commands, I'm merely making a sensible suggestion. Of course, if you  want to make an ass of yourself----"    "I have never had the slightest inclination that way, cheery old sir,"  said Bones, "and I'm not likely at my time of life to be influenced by  my surroundings."    He saluted again and made his way to the barracks. Bones had a  difficulty in packing his stores. In truth they had all been packed  before he reached the _Wiggle_, and to an unprofessional eye they were  packed very well indeed, but Bones had them turned out and packed _his_  way. When that was done, and it was obvious to the meanest intelligence  that the _Wiggle_ was in terrible danger of capsizing before she  started, the stores were unshipped and rearranged under the directions  of the fuming Hamilton.    When the third packing was completed, the general effect bore a  striking resemblance to the position of the stores as Bones had found  them when he came to the boat. When everybody was ready to start, Bones  remembered that he had forgotten his log-book, and there was another  wait.    "Have you got everything now?" asked Sanders wearily, leaning over the  rail.    "Everything, sir," said Bones, with a salute to his superior, and a  smile to the girl.
