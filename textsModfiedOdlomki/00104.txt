It was a glorious daybreak, making my heart light within me, the air  like new milk, and the colours of the sunrise lay purple and yellow in  bars across my room.  I yawned and stretched, then rising, wrapped a  silken quilt about me and went out into the flat terrace top, wherefrom  all the city could be seen stretched in an ivory and emerald patchwork,  with open, blue water on one side, and the Martian plain trending away  in illimitable distance upon the other.
