"What are you going to do with that?" asked Cap'n Bill.    "It's a magic axe," replied the Wizard, "and when I tell it to chop, it  will chop those roots from your feet and you can run to the raft before  they grow again."    "Don't!" shouted the sailor in alarm.  "Don't do it!  Those roots are  all flesh roots, and our bodies are feeding 'em while they're growing  into the ground."    "To cut off the roots," said Trot, "would be like cutting off our  fingers and toes."    The Wizard put the little axe back in the black bag and took out a pair  of silver pincers.    "Grow--grow--grow!" he said to the pincers, and at once they grew and  extended until they reached from the raft to the prisoners.    "What are you going to do now?" demanded Cap'n Bill, fearfully eyeing  the pincers.    "This magic tool will pull you up, roots and all, and land you on this  raft," declared the Wizard.    "Don't do it!" pleaded the sailor, with a shudder.  "It would hurt us  awfully."    "It would be just like pulling teeth to pull us up by the roots,"  explained Trot.    "Grow small!" said the Wizard to the pincers, and at once they became  small and he threw them into the black bag.    "I guess, friends, it's all up with us, this time," remarked Cap'n  Bill, with a dismal sigh.    "Please tell Ozma, Dorothy," said Trot, "that we got into trouble  trying to get her a nice birthday present.  Then she'll forgive us.  The Magic Flower is lovely and wonderful, but it's just a lure to catch  folks on this dreadful island and then destroy them.  You'll have a  nice birthday party, without us, I'm sure; and I hope, Dorothy, that  none of you in the Emerald City will forget me--or dear ol' Cap'n Bill."          19.  Dorothy and the Bumble Bees      Dorothy was greatly distressed and had hard work to keep the tears from  her eyes.
