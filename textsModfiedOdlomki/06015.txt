there.    The door opened as we walked toward the barn. Ristal's tall figure was  framed in the doorway, and behind him stood Kresh, broad and ungainly.  The others crowded up behind them.    "Good work, Marko," Ristal said. We went into the ship, which filled the  whole interior of the barn.    "This is Commander Ristal, of the Venusian Intelligence," I told Copperd  and Beth.    "What's _your_ official title?" Beth asked bitterly.    "I am a special agent and language expert," I told her. Then I explained  why I had brought them here.    "Our civilization is in some way far in advance of yours. As you see, we  have mastered interplanetary travel. But it is essentially a peaceful  civilization. Our weapons, such as we have, are of limited range and  power.    "When it became known that Earth was developing monstrous weapons of  aggression we realized that we must be prepared for the worst. There was  only one way to discover what you already had and what you were working  on. Once we arrived here we found that a man named Copperd was the prime  figure in his country's atomic weapons research. It became our duty to  seek him out."    "I see," Copperd grunted. "And now you expect me to reveal secrets which  I am bound by oath to protect with my very life?"    "You will reveal them," Ristal told him.    I didn't like the way Ristal said that. There was a tinge of cruelty in  his tone and in the sudden tightening of his lips. I hadn't ever worked  with him before, or with Kresh, who was Ristal's second in command, but  I didn't like the methods their manner implied. Copperd looked worried.    "I told you we were a peaceful people," I put in.    "Let me handle this," Ristal said. He pointed to a machine which stood  in a corner.    "That," he explained to Copperd, "is a device which we ordinarily use in  surgery and diagnosis. It has the faculty of making the nerves  infinitely more sensitive to stimuli. Also to pain. Do you understand?"
