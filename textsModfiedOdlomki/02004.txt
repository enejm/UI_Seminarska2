"I was a young man. I seized the reins of power. The survivors--these  old men--were disillusioned and docile. I made myself absolute. I  brought Moon men and women to Eros to serve us as slaves. But in a few  years the last of my father's old compatriots will have died, and thus  it was I conceived of conquering Earth and having men to obey me. For  fifteen years I have been experimenting and constructing apparatus,  with which I now have Earth at my mercy.    "But I shall need assistance, intelligent men who will obey me and aid  me in my plans. That is why I saved you and the other officers of  your ether-lines. If you will join me, you shall have the highest post  on Earth under me, Nathaniel Lee, and those others shall be under  you."    *       *       *       *       *    Axelson paused, and, loathing the man though he did, Nat was conscious  of a feeling of pity for him that he could not control. He saw his  lonely life on Eros, surrounded by those phantom humans of the past,  and he understood his longing for Earth rule--he the planetary exile,  the sole human being of all the planetary system outside Earth,  perhaps, except for his dwindling company of aged men.    "To-day, Nathaniel Lee," Axelson went on, "my life was recast in a new  mould when I saw the woman you have brought with you. I did not know  before that women were beautiful to look on. I did not dream that  creatures such as she existed. She must be mine, Nathaniel Lee.    "But that is immaterial. What is your answer to my offer?"    Nat was trying to think, though passion distorted the mental images as  they arose in his brain. To Axelson it was evidently incomprehensible  that there would be any objection to his taking Madge. Nat saw that he  must temporize for Madge's sake.    "I'll have to consult my companions," he answered.
