 though, don't you think, Septimus? We are still not thirty and could  live another hundred years what with the new arteries they are making  out of Nucrolon and the new tickers they are replacing for the old  ones."    "Let us look over the model again," I says. "You are just moody today,  D'Ambrosia."    It still looks like it would work to me.

It is about twenty feet long and four feet  wide and made out of the strongest metal known to modern science,  cryptoplutonite. It won't heat up or break off and it will start  spinning around as soon as we cut loose with the tail blasts.    "How much time do we need and how much energy for only four thousand  kilometers?"

Infra-Red Cross units, he says, are rocketing to the  area.    "There might be somethin' goin' on inside this earth," I says. "If you
