another; there would be a swift, muttered response, and silence again.  We were waiting--waiting.    Ten minutes went by. Twenty. Thirty.    Impatiently I paced up and down before the exit, the guards at their  posts, ready to obey any orders instantly.    Forty-five minutes. I walked through the exit; stepped out onto the  cold, hard earth.    I could see, behind me, the shadowy bulk of the _Ertak_. Before me, a  black, shapeless blot against the star-sprinkled sky, was the great  administrative building of the Chisee. And in there, somewhere, was  Anderson Croy. I glanced down at the luminous dial of my watch. Fifty  minutes. In ten minutes more--    "John Hanson!" My name reached me, faintly but clearly, through the  medium of my menore. "This is Croy. Do you understand me?"    "Yes," I replied instantly. "Are you safe?"    "I am safe. All is well. Very well. Will you promise me now to receive  what I am about to send, without interruption?"    "Yes," I replied, thoughtlessly and eagerly. "What is it?"    *       *       *       *       *    "I have had a long conference with the chief or head of the Chisee,"  explained Croy rapidly. "He is very intelligent, and his people are  much further advanced than we thought.    "Through some form of communication, he has learned of the fight with  the weird birds; it seems that they are--or were--the most dreaded of  all the creatures of this dark world. Apparently we got the whole  brood of them, and this chief, whose name, I gather, is Wieschien, or  something like that, is naturally much impressed.    "I have given him a demonstration or two with my atomic pistol and the  flashlight--these people are fairly stricken by a ray of light  directly in the eyes--and we have reached very favorable terms.    "I am to remain here as chief bodyguard and adviser, of which he has  need, for all is not peaceful, I gather, in this kingdom of darkness.
