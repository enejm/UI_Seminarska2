Such vessels have the mass of a large asteroid, and one of them can  sterilize a planet; two or three can take it apart. Theoretically, a  task force comprising twenty Nova-class battleships with escorts can  reduce one of those monsters if it is willing to lose most of its  units. But nothing less can even do significant damage, and the rebel  base did not have that much. Nor could they get even what they had into  full action.    The ships rushed out of interstellar space, flashing the recognition  signals I had given. Before the picket vessels suspected what was  wrong, the Valgolians were on them. One managed to bleat a call to base  and the alarm screamed again, men rushed to battle stations. Then the  Imperials blanketed all communications with a snarl of interference  through which nothing the rebels had could drive.    So naturally they were thought to have been annihilated in a few swift  blazes of fire and steel, a quick clean death and forgetfulness of  defeat. But only the drivers were crippled, and then the Supernova  yanked the vessels to its titan flanks and held them in unbreakable  gravity beams. The crews would be taken later, with narcotic gas or  paralyzer beams--alive.    For the Empire needs its rebels.    I knew the uselessness of going to battle stations, so I hung behind,  seeking out Barbara, whose place was with the missile computer bank. I  met her and Kane in the hallway. The boy's face was white, and there  were tears running down his cheeks.    "This is the end," he said. "They've found us out, and there's nothing  left but to die. Good by, Barbara." He kissed her, wildly, and ran for  his ship. Moodily, I watched him go. He expected death, and he would  get only capture, and afterward--
