thin metallic coat on a plastic backing. They're in orbit around us,  each with a small geegee unit to control drift and keep it aimed  directly at the sun. The focused radiation charges heavy-duty  accumulators, which we then collect and use for our power source in  all our mobile work."    "Do you mean you haven't any nuclear generator?" asked Warburton.    He seemed curiously intent about it. Blades wondered why, but nodded.  "That's correct. We don't want one. Too dangerous for us. Nor is it  necessary. Even at this distance from the sun, and allowing for  assorted inefficiencies, a mirror supplies better than five hundred  kilowatts, twenty-four hours a day, year after year, absolutely free."    "Hm-m-m. Yes." Warburton's lean head turned slowly about, to rake  Blades with a look of calculation. "I understand that's the normal  power system in Stations of this type. But we didn't know if it was  used in your case, too."    _Why should you care?_ Blades thought.    He shoved aside his faint unease and urged Ellen toward the dome  railing. "Maybe we can spot your ship, Lieutenant, uh, Miss Ziska.  Here's a telescope. Let me see, her orbit ought to run about so...."    *       *       *       *       *    He hunted until the _Altair_ swam into the viewfield. At this distance  the spheroid looked like a tiny crescent moon, dully painted; but he  could make out the sinister shapes of a rifle turret and a couple of  missile launchers. "Have a look," he invited. Her hair tickled his  nose, brushing past him. It had a delightful sunny odor.    "How small she seems," the girl said, with the same note of wonder as  before. "And how huge when you're aboard."    Big, all right, Blades knew, and loaded to the hatches with nuclear  hellfire. But not massive. A civilian spaceship carried meteor  plating, but since that was about as useful as wet cardboard against  modern weapons, warcraft sacrificed it for the sake of mobility. The
