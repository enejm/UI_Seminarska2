But are you interested in geology?"    "A little," I replied, "that is if there is any chance of making  money out of it, which there ought to be here, as this marble  looks almost as good as that of Carrara.  But flint instruments  are more my line, that is in an ignorant and amateur way, as I  think they are in yours, for I saw some in your room.  Tell me,  what do you think of this.
