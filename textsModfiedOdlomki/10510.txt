   They discussed Bones in terms equally unflattering.  They likened Bones  to all representatives of the animal world whose characteristics are  extreme foolishness, but at last they came into a saner, calmer frame  of mind.    Miss Clara Stegg seated herself on the frowsy sofa--indispensable to a  Pimlico furnished flat--and, with her elbow on one palm and her chin on  another, reviewed the situation.  She was the brains of a little  combination which had done so much to distress and annoy susceptible  financiers in the City of London.  (The record of the Stegg sisters may  be read by the curious, or, at any rate, by as many of the curious as  have the _entr√©e_ to the Record Department of Scotland Yard.)

The elder woman looked at the signature, biting her nether lip.    "It is almost too late now.  What is the time?" she asked.
