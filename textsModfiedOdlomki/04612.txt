 damages."    Broderick shook his head. "It is not possible to replace an immense  fortune at this late date. As I said, you should have reported your  trouble sooner. However, we can give you an opportunity to rebuild. Do  you own an automobile?"    "No."    "A gas range? A gas-fired furnace? A radio?"    Zotul had to answer no to all except the radio. "My wife Lania likes  the music," he explained. "I cannot afford the other things."    Broderick clucked sympathetically. One who could not afford the  bargain-priced merchandise of Earth must be poor indeed.    "To begin with," he said, "I am going to make you a gift of all these  luxuries you do not have." As Zotul made to protest, he cut him off  with a wave of his hand. "It is the least we can do for you. Pick a car  from the lot outside. I will arrange to have the other things delivered  and installed in your home."    "To receive gifts," said Zotul, "incurs an obligation."    "None at all," beamed the Earthman cheerily. "Every item is given to  you absolutely free--a gift from the people of Earth. All we ask is  that you pay the freight charges on the items. Our purpose is not to  make profit, but to spread technology and prosperity throughout the  Galaxy. We have already done well on numerous worlds, but working out  the full program takes time."    He chuckled deeply. "We of Earth have a saying about one of our  extremely slow-moving native animals. We say, 'Slow is the tortoise,  but sure.' And so with us. Our goal is a long-range one, with the  motto, 'Better times with better merchandise.'"    *       *       *       *       *    The engaging manner of the man won Zotul's confidence. After all, it  was no more than fair to pay transportation.    He said, "How much does the freight cost?"    Broderick told him.
