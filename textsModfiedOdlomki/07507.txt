  “And the very reason why the women of this fine country put so little  restraint on their words and actions, is because they live so much in  public, and have really nothing to conceal. Besides, you must have  perceived that the countess was really alarmed.”    “At what? At the sight of that respectable gentleman sitting opposite to  us in the same box with the lovely Greek girl? Now, for my part, I met  them in the lobby after the conclusion of the piece; and hang me, if I  can guess where you took your notions of the other world from. I can  assure you that this hobgoblin of yours is a deuced fine-looking fellow-  -admirably dressed. Indeed, I feel quite sure, from the cut of his  clothes, they are made by a first-rate Paris tailor--probably Blin or  Humann. He was rather too pale, certainly; but then, you know, paleness  is always looked upon as a strong proof of aristocratic descent and  distinguished breeding.” Franz smiled; for he well remembered that  Albert particularly prided himself on the entire absence of color in his  own complexion.    “Well, that tends to confirm my own ideas,” said Franz, “that the  countess’s suspicions were destitute alike of sense and reason. Did he  speak in your hearing? and did you catch any of his words?”    “I did; but they were uttered in the Romaic dialect. I knew that from  the mixture of Greek words. I don’t know whether I ever told you that  when I was at college I was rather--rather strong in Greek.”    “He spoke the Romaic language, did he?”    “I think so.”    “That settles it,” murmured Franz. “‘Tis he, past all doubt.”    “What do you say?”    “Nothing, nothing. But tell me, what were you thinking about when I came  in?”    “Oh, I was arranging a little surprise for you.”    “Indeed. Of what nature?”    “Why, you know it is quite impossible to procure a carriage.”    “Certainly; and I also know that we have done all that human means  afforded to endeavor to get one.”
