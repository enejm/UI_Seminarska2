importance to the world than a presidential election. The rest of the  boys tried to cheer him up. "A fine state of things," said Murren  bitterly. "Think of the scrap next week between the California Duffer  and Pigeon Billy and no report of it in the Argus! Imagine the walk-  over for the other papers. What in thunder does he think people want to  read?"    But there was another surprise in store for the boys. McCrasky  assembled them all in his room and held forth to them. He suddenly  sprung a question on the criminal reporter--so suddenly that Thompson,  taken unawares, almost spoke the truth.    "Do you know of any gambling houses in this city?"    Thompson caught his breath and glanced quickly at Murren.    "No," he said at last. "I don't, but perhaps the religious editor does.  Better ask him."    The religious editor smiled and removed his corn-cob pipe.    "There aren't any," he said. "Didn't you know it was against the law to  keep a gambling house in this state? Yes, sir!" Then he put his corn-  cob pipe back in its place.    McCrasky was pleased to see that his young men knew so little of the  wickedness of a great city; nevertheless he was there to give them some  information, so he said quietly:    "Certainly it is against the law; but many things that are against the  law flourish in a city like this. Now I want you to find out before the  week is past how many gambling houses there are and where they are  located. When you are sure of your facts we will organize a raid and  the news will very likely be exclusive, for it will be late at night  and the other papers may not hear of it."    "Suppose," said the religious editor, with a twinkle in his eye, as he  again removed his corn-cob, "that--assuming such places to exist--you  found some representatives of the other papers there? They are a bad  lot, the fellows on the other papers."    "If they are there," said the local editor, "they will go to prison."
