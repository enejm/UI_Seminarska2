  "What's the matter, Marko?" Beth asked as I pulled away.    I didn't know what was wrong. I didn't try to figure it out. I had to  get out of there and try to regain my equilibrium. On a mission like  mine I had to keep my head.    "Shall I see you tomorrow?" I said.    "All the tomorrow's you want," Beth answered.    There was eagerness, and yet a note of regret. It was as though she  instinctively knew that something was wrong. But my work had been well  done; she was in too far, and I had cut her emotional line of retreat.    I saw Beth the next afternoon, and the next evening. My presence on the  porch and in her home became such a common thing that the security agent  hardly gave me a glance now.    Those few days passed by swiftly, and yet each hour in those days was  long. I was very cautious; Beth and I kissed many times but I never  allowed myself to be moved as on that first time.    Sunday loomed larger and larger, closer and closer. I was a constant and  ever present guest. It was an elementary matter to get Beth to invite me  for Sunday dinner. The invitation came on Saturday night, and that night  when I came back to my room I called Ristal for the first time since we  had arrived.    "Tomorrow," I said into the _besnal_. "Early evening."    "Good."    That was all we said, but it was enough. Our frequency was too high to  be picked up. Still, we were taking no chances. Ristal knew precisely  what I meant and he would be ready.    I had the feeling that comes when a mission is about to be completed.  There was a feeling of tension, and yet for the first time in my career  I had a lowering of spirits that I could not explain.    The feeling persisted until late Sunday afternoon. Then I pushed it from  my mind. I dressed carefully, slipped the _besnal_ into my inner pocket,  and put my _del_ gun in my coat pocket.
