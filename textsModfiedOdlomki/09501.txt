  H. RIDER HAGGARD.    DITCHINGHAM, 1905.          AUTHORâ€™S NOTE    Not with a view of conciliating those readers who on principle object to  sequels, but as a matter of fact, the Author wishes to say that he does  not so regard this book.    Rather does he venture to ask that it should be considered as the  conclusion of an imaginative tragedy (if he may so call it) whereof one  half has been already published.    This conclusion it was always his desire to write should he be destined  to live through those many years which, in obedience to his original  design, must be allowed to lapse between the events of the first and  second parts of the romance.    In response to many enquiries he may add that the name Ayesha, which  since the days of the prophet Mahomet, who had a wife so called, and  perhaps before them, has been common in the East, should be pronounced  _Assha_.          INTRODUCTION    Verily and indeed it is the unexpected that happens! Probably if there  was one person upon the earth from whom the Editor of this, and of a  certain previous history, did not expect to hear again, that person was  Ludwig Horace Holly. This, too, for a good reason; he believed him to  have taken his departure from the earth.    When Mr. Holly last wrote, many, many years ago, it was to transmit the  manuscript of _She_, and to announce that he and his ward, Leo Vincey,  the beloved of the divine Ayesha, were about to travel to Central Asia  in the hope, I suppose, that there she would fulfil her promise and  appear to them again.    Often I have wondered, idly enough, what happened to them there; whether  they were dead, or perhaps droning their lives away as monks in some  Thibetan Lamasery, or studying magic and practising asceticism under  the tuition of the Eastern Masters trusting that thus they would build a  bridge by which they might pass to the side of their adored Immortal.
