as the blood-stream cleared in my veins.    I was victor. Coniston was dead. I saw now, down on the lower  staircase below the camp-ledge, another goggled figure lying huddled.  That was Wilks, no doubt. Coniston had doubtless caught him there,  surprised him, killed him.    My attention, as I stood gazing, went down to the camp-buildings.  Another figure was outside! It bounded along the ledge, reached the  foot of the ascending staircase at the top of which I was standing.  With agile leaps, it came mounting at me!    Another brigand! Miko? No, it was not large enough to be Miko, not  nearly large enough. I was still confused. I thought of Hahn. But that  was absurd. Hahn was in the wreck of the _Planetara_. One of the  stewards then....    The figure came up the staircase recklessly, to assail me. I took a  step backward, bracing myself to receive this new antagonist.    And then I saw Miko! Unquestionably he: for there was no mistaking  his giant figure. He was down on the camp-ledge, running toward the  foot of the staircase, coming up to help this other man in advance of  him.    I thought of my revolver. I turned to try and find it. I was aware  that the first of my assailants was at the stairhead. I could not  locate at once where the revolver had fallen. I would be caught,  leaped upon from behind. Should I run?    I swung back to see what the oncoming brigand was doing. He had  reached the summit. His arms went up, legs bent under him. With a  sailing leap he launched for me. I could have bounded way, but with a  last look to locate the revolver, I braced myself for the shock.    The figure hit me. It was small and light in my clutching arms. I  recall I saw that Miko was half-way up the staircase. I gripped my  assailant. The audiphone contact brought a voice.    "Gregg! Is it you?"    It was Anita clutching at me!      CHAPTER XXVI    _At Bay_    "Gregg, you're safe!"
