   "Yes, that’s it; but I never could recollect it."    "All the better. What more did he ask you?"    "Who M. Getard was."    "Next?"    "Who M. Jupenet was."    "He did not happen to see our plan of fortifications, did he?"    "Yes."    "The devil he did!"    "But don’t be alarmed, I had rubbed out your writing with India-rubber.  It was impossible for him to suppose you had given me any advice in  those works."    "Ay; but our friend has phenomenally keen eyes."    "What are you afraid of?"    "I fear that everything is discovered, Porthos; the matter is, then, to  prevent a great misfortune. I have given orders to my people to close  all the gates and doors. D’Artagnan will not be able to get out before  daybreak. Your horse is ready saddled; you will gain the first relay; by  five o’clock in the morning you will have traversed fifteen leagues.  Come!"    Aramis then assisted Porthos to dress, piece by piece, with as much  celerity as the most skillful valet de chambre could have done. Porthos,  half stupefied, let him do as he liked, and confounded himself in  excuses. When he was ready, Aramis took him by the hand, and led him,  making him place his foot with precaution on every step of the stairs,  preventing him running against door-frames, turning him this way and  that, as if Aramis had been the giant and Porthos the dwarf. Soul set  fire to and animated matter. A horse was waiting, ready saddled, in the  courtyard. Porthos mounted. Then Aramis himself took the horse by the  bridle, and led him over some dung spread in the yard, with the evident  intention of suppressing noise. He, at the same time, held tight the  horse’s nose, to prevent him neighing. When arrived at the outward gate,  drawing Porthos towards him, who was going off without even asking him  what for: "Now, friend Porthos, now; without drawing bridle, till you  get to Paris," whispered he in his ears; "eat on horseback, drink on  horseback, but lose not a minute."
