showed them going through the passage to the outside. "We will come  back, and we will find some way to end all this damnable thing."    She gave them to understand the time that was left. The sun, she  showed, was long past the meridian and was on its return. The day was  now reaching a close. And then, as the sun set, the great sacrifice  would be made--had always been made--to insure the return of their  god.    *       *       *       *       *    Their watches were useless, for the water had entered their cases. The  two men waited what they judged was the length of a day, while Jerry  tried to believe that his arm was improving. Then, putting a small  supply of food in their pockets, they were ready for the attempt.    Jerry saw that his gun and knife were ready at his belt, and patted a  pocket where his matches were safe in their watertight container. The  prospect of escape almost unnerved him. To breathe the clear air; to  stand in the radiant light of the sun--he could understand now how  these people made a god of the sun. He turned to Marahna.    "Good-by," he said, "but not for long. We'll be back. And we'll save  you, Marahna, we'll save you. Winslow will figure some way to do  it.... We'll be back...."    The girl was silent. She touched Jerry's arm, and shook her head  slowly, doubtfully.    He reached for the hand. It trembled, he felt, in his. The impulse to  take the slim form within his arms, to hold her close, was strong upon  him. Would he ever see her again ... would he?    "Won't you say good-by, Marahna?" he asked.    But she smiled, instead--a friendly smile, and encouraging. Then  dropped in silence to her knees to press with both her trembling hands  his hand upon her forehead. And, still in silence, she rose to vanish  from the room.
