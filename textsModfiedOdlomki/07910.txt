 you see now?”    “I see one, two, four musicians with their instruments, and behind them,  urging them on, De Guiche himself. What is he doing there, though?”    “He is waiting until the little door of the staircase, belonging to the  ladies of honor, is opened; by that staircase he will ascend to Madame’s  apartments, where some new pieces of music are going to be performed  during dinner.”    “This is admirable news you tell me.”    “Is it not, monsieur?”    “Was it M. de Malicorne who told you this?”    “Yes, monsieur.”    “He likes you, then?”    “No, monsieur, it is Monsieur that he likes.”    “Why?”    “Because he wishes to belong to his household.”    “And most certainly he shall. How much did he give you for that?”    “The secret which I now dispose of to you, monsieur.”    “And which I buy for a hundred pistoles. Take them.”    “Thank you, monsieur. Look, look, the little door opens; a woman admits  the musicians.”    “It is Montalais.”    “Hush, monseigneur; do not call out her name; whoever says Montalais  says Malicorne. If you quarrel with the one, you will be on bad terms  with the other.”    “Very well; I have seen nothing.”    “And I,” said the valet, pocketing the purse, “have received nothing.”    The chevalier, being now certain that Guiche had entered, returned to  the prince, whom he found splendidly dressed and radiant with joy, as  with good looks. “I am told,” he exclaimed, “that the king has taken the  sun as his device; really, monseigneur, it is you whom this device would  best suit.”    “Where is De Guiche?”    “He cannot be found. He has fled--has evaporated entirely. Your scolding  of this morning terrified him. He could not be found in his apartments.”    “Bah! the hair-brained fellow is capable of setting off post-haste to  his own estates. Poor man! we will recall him. Come, let us dine now.”    “Monseigneur, to-day is a very festival of ideas; I have another.”
