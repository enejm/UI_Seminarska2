straight border with no transition between city and farmland.    There was a faint hum. Then a long, low streak, its front end rounded  like a horseshoe crab, shot out of the tunnel under the building beside  him and vanished along the road where he'd just been walking.    Now Dan saw a small modest sign beside the road.    Care  High-Speed  Vehicles Only  --_Swept_--    Dan crossed the rail at the end of the street with great caution.    The Porcyn clothing he was wearing consisted of low leather boots,  long green hose, leather shorts, a bright purple blouse and a sky-blue  cape. Dan bunched the cape in his hand and thrust it ahead of him as  he crossed the rail, for some races were finicky about their exits and  entrances. The straight, sharp boundary between city and farmland,  and the identical buildings, suggested to Dan that here was a race  controlled by strict rules and forms, and he was making an obviously  unauthorized entrance.    It was with relief that he stood on the opposite side, within the city.  He glanced back at the sign and wondered what "Swept" meant. Then he  gave his attention to the buildings ahead of him.    *       *       *       *       *    Low at first, the buildings rose regularly to a greater height, as far  as the fog would let him see. Dan remembered the storm of the night  before and wondered if the progressive heightening of the buildings was  designed to break the force of the wind. The buildings themselves were  massive, with few and narrow windows, and wide heavy doors opening on  the street.    Dan walked farther into the city and found that the street took  right-angle bends at regular intervals, probably also to break the  wind. There was no one in sight, and no vehicles.
