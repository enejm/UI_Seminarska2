21  The Flight to the Jungle  22  Tarzan Recovers His Reason  23  A Night of Terror  24  Home          1    Belgian and Arab      Lieutenant Albert Werper had only the prestige of the name he had  dishonored to thank for his narrow escape from being cashiered.  At  first he had been humbly thankful, too, that they had sent him to this  Godforsaken Congo post instead of court-martialing him, as he had so  justly deserved; but now six months of the monotony, the frightful  isolation and the loneliness had wrought a change.  The young man  brooded continually over his fate.  His days were filled with morbid  self-pity, which eventually engendered in his weak and vacillating mind  a hatred for those who had sent him here--for the very men he had at  first inwardly thanked for saving him from the ignominy of degradation.    He regretted the gay life of Brussels as he never had regretted the  sins which had snatched him from that gayest of capitals, and as the  days passed he came to center his resentment upon the representative in  Congo land of the authority which had exiled him--his captain and  immediate superior.    This officer was a cold, taciturn man, inspiring little love in those  directly beneath him, yet respected and feared by the black soldiers of  his little command.    Werper was accustomed to sit for hours glaring at his superior as the  two sat upon the veranda of their common quarters, smoking their  evening cigarets in a silence which neither seemed desirous of  breaking.  The senseless hatred of the lieutenant grew at last into a  form of mania.  The captain's natural taciturnity he distorted into a  studied attempt to insult him because of his past shortcomings.  He  imagined that his superior held him in contempt, and so he chafed and  fumed inwardly until one evening his madness became suddenly homicidal.  He fingered the butt of the revolver at his hip, his eyes narrowed and  his brows contracted.  At last he spoke.
