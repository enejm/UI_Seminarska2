   "Yes," he responded, "the plan. Ban stations a man to keep watch on  Tantril's ranch, while we go back to your laboratory, Eliot, where  you'll make the devices and repair the gravity-plates of my suit.  Then, four nights from now, if the watcher's seen no one arrive, Ban,  Friday and I return and lie in ambush round Tantril's ranch. Awaiting  Dr. Ku.

Ban Wilson had manned and made ready his personal space-ship for the  trip to the laboratory, and Eliot Leithgow had jotted down a few  preliminary plans for the infra-red and ultra-violet instruments  which Carse would need in order to see the invisible asteroid of Dr.  Ku Sui.
