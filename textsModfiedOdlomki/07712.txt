 The queen had passed the night in lonely conference with the prince, who  had entered the oratory at midnight and did not leave till five o’clock  in the morning.    At five o’clock Anne went to the cardinal’s room. If she had not yet  taken any repose, he at least was already up. Six days had already  passed out of the ten he had asked from Mordaunt; he was therefore  occupied in revising his reply to Cromwell, when some one knocked gently  at the door of communication with the queen’s apartments. Anne of  Austria alone was permitted to enter by that door. The cardinal  therefore rose to open it.    The queen was in a morning gown, but it became her still; for, like  Diana of Poictiers and Ninon, Anne of Austria enjoyed the privilege of  remaining ever beautiful; nevertheless, this morning she looked  handsomer than usual, for her eyes had all the sparkle inward  satisfaction adds to expression.    “What is the matter, madame?” said Mazarin, uneasily. “You seem secretly  elated.”    “Yes, Giulio,” she said, “proud and happy; for I have found the means of  strangling this hydra.”    “You are a great politician, my queen,” said Mazarin; “let us hear the  means.” And he hid what he had written by sliding the letter under a  folio of blank paper.    “You know,” said the queen, “that they want to take the king away from  me?”    “Alas! yes, and to hang me.”    “They shall not have the king.”    “Nor hang me.”    “Listen. I want to carry off my son from them, with yourself. I wish  that this event, which on the day it is known will completely change the  aspect of affairs, should be accomplished without the knowledge of any  others but yourself, myself, and a third person.”    “And who is this third person?”    “Monsieur le Prince.”    “He has come, then, as they told me?”    “Last evening.”    “And you have seen him?”    “He has just left me.”    “And will he aid this project?”
