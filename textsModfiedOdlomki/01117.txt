  Lectures. The organization of a Society of Martian Archaeology, with  Anthony Lattimer, Ph.D., the logical candidate for the chair. Degrees,  honors; the deference of the learned, and the adulation of the lay  public. Positions, with impressive titles and salaries. Sweet are the  uses of publicity.
