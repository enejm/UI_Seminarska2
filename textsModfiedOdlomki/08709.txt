for being brave fellows, after a pause of perhaps five minutes, once  more they charged in a body, hoping to overwhelm us. Again we greeted  them with bullets and knocked out several, whereon the rest threw  a volley of their long spears at us. I was glad to see them do this  although one of the Zulus got his death from it, while two more were  wounded. I myself had a very narrow escape, for a spear passed between  my neck and shoulder.
