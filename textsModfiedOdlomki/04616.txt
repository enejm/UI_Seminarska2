   But at the end of three years, the Earthmen dropped their option.  The Pottery of Masur had no more contracts. Business languished. The  Earthmen, explained Broderick, had built a plant of their own because  it was so much more efficient--and to lower prices, which was Earth's  unswerving policy, greater and greater efficiency was demanded.  Broderick was very sympathetic, but there was nothing he could do.    The introduction of television provided a further calamity. The sets  were delicate and needed frequent repairs, hence were costly to own and  maintain. But all Zurians who had to keep up with the latest from Earth  had them. Now it was possible not only to hear about things of Earth,  but to see them as they were broadcast from the video tapes.

"You got us into this," they said, emphasizing their bitterness with  fists. "Go see Broderick. Tell him we are undone and must have some  contracts to continue operating."    Nursing bruises, Zotul unhappily went to the Council House again. Mr.
