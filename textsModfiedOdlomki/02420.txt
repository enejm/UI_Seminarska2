 people are gone, wiped out, but that if she will cast her lot with us,  we will not forget what she has done. Come on!"    With Gori leading them they ran, stumbling, recovering themselves,  stumbling again. To breathe became an agony. But not until many minutes  later, when they plowed into the cover of a fern belt whose blackness  not even the moonlight had pierced, did Kirby call a halt.    Here he swept a final glance behind him, listened long for sounds of  pursuit, and relaxed a little only when none came to disturb the night  stillness. However, that relaxation, now that he permitted it at last,  meant something.    The complete silence gave him final conviction that what he had said  about the whole ape-people being destroyed was true. As for the  Serpent--well, perhaps he was destroyed even as they were. Perhaps not.  In any case the grip which Quetzalcoatl held upon the imagination of the  People of the Temple had been destroyed by this night's work, and that  was what counted most. The Serpent would be worshipped no longer.    *       *       *       *       *    Kirby reached out in the darkness and found Naida's hand.    "Come along," he said to all of the party. "I think the past is--the  past. And with Gori to guide us out of the jungle, and our own brains to  guide us through the jungle of self-government after that, I think the  future ought to be bright enough."    Ivana and Nini both chuckled as they moved again, and Gori, hearing her  name spoken in a kindly voice, twitched her ears appreciatively. Naida  drew very close to Kirby.    "What are you thinking about?" she asked presently.    "The--temple," he answered.    "About the crown which probably is still lying on the altar there?"    Kirby looked up in surprise.    "Why, I had forgotten about that!"    "What was it, then?"
