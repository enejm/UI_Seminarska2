chains--but he was Hawk Carse! And so, as he shuffled out through the  front door of the house and lumbered with painful effort across the  clearing, he was surrounded by a glitter of ray-guns held by the  close-pressing circle of men. Tantril's own gun kept steady on his  broad fabric-clad back, and of its proximity he kept reminding Carse.    New guards were already on watch on each of the three  watch-platforms, their eyes sweeping around the clearing and the  jungle and the dark stretch of the lake, and often returning to the  crowd which marked the stumbling giant's progress below. Each point of  defense was manned. In the ranch's central control room, a  steel-sheathed cubby in the basement of Tantril's house, men stood  watchful, their hands ready at the wheels and levers which commanded  the ranch's ray-batteries, their eyes on the vision-screen which gave  to this unseen heart of the place a panoramic view of what was  transpiring above. And all waited on what the grotesque, bloated  figure they watched might reveal.    Watch--watch--watch. A hundred eyes, below, above, beside the Hawk,  were centered and alert on each move of his clumsy progress. The  barrels of two-score ray-guns transfixed him. Under such guard he  arrived at the ranch's fence where it approached the Great Briney.    "Open the gate," said the Hawk curtly. "It's down there."    He pointed to where the lake's pebbled beach shelved downward to the  tiny murmurous waves, a ten-foot stretch of ghostly white between the  guarding fence and the water.    "Down there?" repeated Tantril slowly. "Down to the lake?"    "Yes!" Carse snapped irritably. "Well, will you open the gate? I'm  very tired: I can't bear this suit much longer."    *       *       *       *       *    Lar Tantril conferred uneasily with Esret, while his men cast  shivering glances out over the dark wind-rippled plain of the lake.  But no enemy showed there. The beach was clear for fifty yards on each  side.
