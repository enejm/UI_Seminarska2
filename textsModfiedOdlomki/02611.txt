He drew a deep breath--and felt a dim pain in his back, caused by the  cramping position in which he had lain for so long.    He could have shouted aloud with the thrill of that discovery. This  was the first time he had felt his body at all! Did it mean that the  effect of the poison was wearing off--that it wasn't as lastingly  paralyzing to his earthly nerve centers as to those of Zeudian  creatures around them? He flexed the muscles of his leg. The leg moved  a fraction of an inch.    "Dorn!" he called softly, "I can move a little! Can you?"
