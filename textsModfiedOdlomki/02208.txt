Then a strange phenomenon obtruded itself upon Dick's notice. _Nothing  was audible!_ The bombs were falling, but they were falling silently.  No sound came up from beneath. And, except for the throbbing of his  engine, Dick would have thought it had stopped. He could no longer  hear it.    That terrific holocaust of death and destruction was inaudible.  Skimming the upper reach of the air, high above that wall of darkness,  Dick saw old Luke Evans pick up his end of the speaking-tube, and  mechanically followed suit. He could see the old man's lips moving.  But he heard nothing!    And now another phenomenon was borne in on his notice. His flight were  perhaps five hundred feet beneath him, hovering a little above the  barrage of black gas. But they were converging oddly. And there was no  sight of the airplanes that Dick had just seen taking off from the  invisible tarmac.    *       *       *       *       *    Dick fired two Very lights as a signal to his flight to scatter. What  were they doing, bunching together like a flock of sheep, when at any  moment the enemy planes might come swooping in, riddling them with  bullets? He thrust the stick forward--and then realized that his  controls had gone dead!    He thought for a moment that a wire had snapped. But the stick  responded perfectly to his hand, only it had no longer control over  his plane. He kicked right rudder, and the plane remained motionless.  He pushed home the soaring lever, to neutralize the helicopter and the  plane still soared.    Then he noticed that the needle of his earth-inductor  compass-indicator was oscillating madly, and realized that it was not  his plane that was at fault.    Underneath him, his flight seemed to be milling wildly as the ships  turned in every direction of the compass. But not for long. They were  nosing in, until the whole flight resembled an enormous airplane  engine, with twelve radial points, corresponding to their propellers,
