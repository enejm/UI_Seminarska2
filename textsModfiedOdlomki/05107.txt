"Well," McGill said, "I'm trying to think of anything else it might be.  I'm not doing so well," he confessed.    "But so far as I can see," Molly answered, "it's mere probability, and  without any over-all pattern."    "Not quite. It has a center. Alec is the center."    *       *       *       *       *    Molly looked at me with a curious expression for a moment. "Do you  _feel_ all right, darling?" she asked me. I nodded brightly. "You'll  think this silly of me," she went on to McGill, "but why isn't it  something like an overactive poltergeist?"    "Pure concept," he said. "No genuine evidence."    "Magnetism?"    "Absolutely not. For one thing, most of the objects affected weren't  magnetic--and don't forget magnetism is a force, not a form of energy,  and a great deal of energy has been involved. I admit the energy has  mainly been supplied by the things themselves, but in a magnetic field,  all you'd get would be stored kinetic energy, such as when a piece of  iron moves to a magnet or a line of force. Then it would just stay  there, like a rundown clock weight. These things do a lot more than  that--they go on moving."    "Why did you mention a crystal before? Why not a life-form?"    "Only an analogy," said McGill. "A crystal resembles life in that it  has a definite shape and exhibits growth, but that's all. I'll agree  this--thing--has no discernible shape and motion _is_ involved, but  plants don't move and amebas have no shape. Then a crystal feeds, but  it does not convert what it feeds on; it merely rearranges it into a  non-random pattern. In this case, it's rearranging random motions and  it has a nucleus and it seems to be growing--at least in what you might  call improbability."    Molly frowned. "Then what _is_ it? What's it made of?"    "I should say it was made of the motions. There's a similar idea about
