  An eery scream came suddenly from Durkin's lips; Maget wrung his hands  and called for help.    "Come out, Bill, come out," he cried.    Durkin evidently tried to obey, for he turned toward the door. But his  knees seemed to give way beneath him, he threw his arm across his eyes  as he sank to the ground, crying in agony, incoherent sounds issuing  from his lips.
