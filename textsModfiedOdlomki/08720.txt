because it wished to get back to its mother which it loved, and that it  was cruel to separate it from its mother.    We made good progress and by the evening of the first day were over the  crest of the cliff or volcano lip that encircles the great plain of KÃ´r,  and descending rapidly to a sheltered spot on the outer slope where our  camp was to be set for the night.    Not very far from this place, as I think I have mentioned, stood, and I  suppose still stands, a very curious pinnacle of rock, which, doubtless  being of some harder sort, had remained when, hundreds of thousands or  millions of years before, the surrounding lava had been washed or had  corroded away.
