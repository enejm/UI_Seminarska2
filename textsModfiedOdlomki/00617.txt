  "And wasn't Ozma in it then?"    "There was no one in it but me, and I was sorry it wasn't entirely  empty.  The sides are so steep I can't climb out, so there was nothing  to be done but sleep until someone found me.  Thank you for coming. If  you'll please let down a rope, I'll empty this hole in a hurry."    "How strange!" said Dorothy, greatly disappointed.    "It's evident the Pink Bear didn't tell the truth."    "He never makes a mistake," declared the Lavender Bear King in a tone  that showed his feelings were hurt.  And then he turned the crank of  the little Pink Bear again and asked, "Is this the hole that Ozma of Oz  is in?"    "Yes," answered the Pink Bear.    "That settles it," said the King positively.  "Your Ozma is in this  hole in the ground."    "Don't be silly," returned Dorothy impatiently. "Even your beady eyes  can see there is no one in the hole but Button-Bright."    "Perhaps Button-Bright is Ozma," suggested the King.    "And perhaps he isn't!  Ozma is a girl, and Button-Bright is a boy."    "Your Pink Bear must be out of order," said the Wizard, "for, this time  at least, his machinery has caused him to make an untrue statement."    The Bear King was so angry at this remark that he turned away, holding  the Pink Bear in his paws, and refused to discuss the matter in any  further way.    "At any rate," said the Frogman, "the Pink Bear has led us to your boy  friend and so enabled you to rescue him."    Scraps was leaning so far over the hole trying to find Ozma in it that  suddenly she lost her balance and pitched in head foremost.  She fell  upon Button-Bright and tumbled him over, but he was not hurt by her  soft, stuffed body and only laughed at the mishap.  The Wizard buckled  some straps together and let one end of them down into the hole, and  soon both Scraps and the boy had climbed up and were standing safely
