Motors in the night.    And the dull determination growing, strengthening.    The airport, baggage, the ancient taxi with the piston slap, and at last  the dark, familiar street.    "Jim, you're back! Oh, Jim, darling. Next time they send you west I'm  going too. I am!"    "Okay, Jean, sure. Why not?"    "What's the matter, dear? Oh, you're tired, of course. I should have  known. Sit down, Jim. Let me get you a drink."    "In a minute, Jean." Do it now _now_ NOW! "Where's Joanna?"    "She's in bed. Hours ago. Jim, has something--?"    "Nothing, dear. I just want to look in on her. And freshen up a bit, of  course."    "Jim--"    He smoothed away the worried frown with his forefinger.    "In a minute, dear."    She smiled uncertainly. "Hurry back, Jim."    *       *       *       *       *    The stairs unwind irrevocably, slow motion in a nightmare. The bedroom  door opens, the hall light dim on the bed and the child's face. Incubus  in the half dark.    For a moment Jim remembered wondering somewhere, sometime, what strange  powers of protection might be implicit in such a creature. As the  thought came into his mind, Joanna stirred. She opened her eyes and  looked at him.    He took one step toward the bed.    The little girl eyes over their dusting of freckles slitted. Then they  opened wide, became two glowing golden lakes that grew, and grew--    There was the feeling of a great soundless explosion in his mind. Waves  of cool burning in his brain, churning and bubbling in every unknown  corner, every cranny. Here and there a cell, or a group of cells,  blanked out, the complex molecules reverting, becoming new again. Ready  for fresh punch marks. Synapses shorted with soundless cold fire, and  waited in timeless stasis for rechannelling. The waves frothed, became  ripples, were gone. He stood unmoving.
