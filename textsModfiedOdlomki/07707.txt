“Nonsense!” cried D’Artagnan, “they’ll suppose us to be stronger than  themselves, as we’re in pursuit; they’ll be afraid and will disperse.”    “Certainly,” remarked Porthos.    “Ah! do you see?” cried the lieutenant.    “The lights again! this time I, too, saw them,” said Porthos.    “On! on! forward! forward!” cried D’Artagnan, in his stentorian voice;  “we shall laugh over all this in five minutes.”    And they darted on anew.
