mostly, with a few ashes and beeches.  On the dovecot I was almost on a  level with the tree-tops, and could see what lay beyond.  The wood was  not solid, but only a ring, and inside was an oval of green turf, for  all the world like a big cricket-field.    I didn't take long to guess what it was.  It was an aerodrome, and a  secret one.  The place had been most cunningly chosen.  For suppose  anyone were watching an aeroplane descending here, he would think it  had gone over the hill beyond the trees.

The moon was well on its last quarter  and would not rise till late.  My thirst was too great to allow me to  tarry, so about nine o'clock, so far as I could judge, I started to
