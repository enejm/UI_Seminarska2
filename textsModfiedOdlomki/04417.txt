"Well, Holy Smokes. I mean--Holy Smokes." Red looked up. "I tell you. My  Dad said to get rid of them. Let's sort of bury them somewhere or throw  them in the creek."    "He _told_ you to do that."    "He made me say I had animals and then he said, 'Get rid of them.' I got  to do what he says. Holy Smokes, he's my Dad."    Some of the panic left Slim's heart. It was a thoroughly legalistic way  out. "Well, let's do it right now, then, before they find out. Oh,  golly, if they find out, will we be in trouble!"    They broke into a run toward the barn, unspeakable visions in their  minds.      IX    It was different, looking at them as though they were "people." As  animals, they had been interesting; as "people," horrible. Their eyes,  which were neutral little objects before, now seemed to watch them with  active malevolence.    "They're making noises," said Slim, in a whisper which was barely  audible.    "I guess they're talking or something," said Red. Funny that those  noises which they had heard before had not had significance earlier. He  was making no move toward them. Neither was Slim.    The canvas was off but they were just watching. The ground meat, Slim  noticed, hadn't been touched.    Slim said, "Aren't you going to do something?"    "Aren't you?"    "You found them."    "It's your turn, now."    "No, it isn't. You found them. It's your fault, the whole thing. I was  watching."    "You joined in, Slim. You know you did."    "I don't care. You found them and that's what I'll say when they come  here looking for us."    Red said, "All right for you." But the thought of the consequences  inspired him anyway, and he reached for the cage door.    Slim said, "Wait!"    Red was glad to. He said, "Now what's biting you?"    "One of them's got something on him that looks like it might be iron or  something."
