roof. There was little that could be seen, for always the mighty, cold  winds, ruffed with flurries of snow and particles of ice, swept over  this artificial roof of the world. Here and there huge portions of the  area within the range of his normal vision were swept clear and clean of  snow and ice--and looked bluely, bitterly cold and hostile.    Without the Sarka-Belts, people who ventured forth from their hives  would instantly freeze to the consistency of marble in those winds and  storms. For the people of Earth had built their monster habitation  toward the stars until they reached up into the altitude of perpetual  cold.    Only under that gleaming roof was there warmth. Many of the men, and  women, and children who had lost in the now century-old fight for  survival had merely been tossed out of the hives.

On the table before Sarka was a row of vari-colored lights, whose source  was beneath the floor of the laboratory, out of the heart of the  master-mountain, part of the intricate machinery of this laboratory  which had been almost twenty centuries in the perfecting.
