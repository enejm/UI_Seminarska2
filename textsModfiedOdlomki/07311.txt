mind, for with the coming of daylight the half-famished hyenas renewed  their efforts to break down the frail barrier which kept them from  their prey.  Rearing upon their hind feet they clawed and struck at the  lattice.  With wide eyes Tibo saw it sag and rock.  Not for long, he  knew, could it withstand the assaults of these two powerful and  determined brutes.  Already one corner had been forced past the rocky  protuberance of the entrance way which had held it in place.  A shaggy  forearm protruded into the chamber.  Tibo trembled as with ague, for he  knew that the end was near.    Backing against the farther wall he stood flattened out as far from the  beasts as he could get.  He saw the lattice give still more.  He saw a  savage, snarling head forced past it, and grinning jaws snapping and  gaping toward him.  In another instant the pitiful fabric would fall  inward, and the two would be upon him, rending his flesh from his  bones, gnawing the bones themselves, fighting for possession of his  entrails.    * * *    Bukawai came upon Momaya outside the palisade of Mbonga, the chief.  At  sight of him the woman drew back in revulsion, then she flew at him,  tooth and nail; but Bukawai threatening her with a spear held her at a  safe distance.    "Where is my baby?" she cried.  "Where is my little Tibo?"    Bukawai opened his eyes in well-simulated amazement.  "Your baby!" he  exclaimed.  "What should I know of him, other than that I rescued him  from the white god of the jungle and have not yet received my pay.  I  come for the goats and the sleeping mat and the piece of copper wire  the length of a tall man's arm from the shoulder to the tips of his  fingers." "Offal of a hyena!" shrieked Momaya.  "My child has been  stolen, and you, rotting fragment of a man, have taken him.  Return him  to me or I shall tear your eyes from your head and feed your heart to  the wild hogs."
