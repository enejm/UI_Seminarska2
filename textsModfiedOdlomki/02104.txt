 crept along the floor. Rose up suddenly at the window.    And stared at a face peering in at me. A small face, framed by short,  clustering, dark curls.    A girl!          CHAPTER III    _In a Moonlit Garden_      She drew back from the window like a startled fawn; timorous, yet  curious, too, for she ran only a few steps, then turned and stood  peering. The moonlight slanted over the western roof of the building and  fell on her. A slight, boyish figure in short, tattered trousers and a  boy's shirt, open at her slim, rounded throat. The moonlight gleamed on  the white shirt fabric to show it torn and ragged. Her arms were  upraised; her head, with clustering, flying dark curls, was tilted as  though listening for a sound from me. A shy, wild creature.

The moonlight was on me as I stood there. I was conscious  of its etching me with its silver sheen. And twenty feet from me this  girl stood and gazed, with startled eyes and parted lips--and white  limbs trembling like a frightened animal.    The patio was very silent. The heavy arching fronds stirred slightly  with a vague night breeze; the moonlight threw a lacy dark pattern of  them on the gray stone path. The fountain bowl gleamed white in the  moonlight behind the girl, and in the silence I could hear the low  splashing of the water.    A magic moment. Unforgettable. It comes to some of us just once, but to  all of us it comes. I stood with its spell upon me. Then I heard my  voice, tense but softly raised.    "Who are you?"    It frightened her. She retreated until the fountain was between us. And  as I took a step forward, she retreated further, noiseless, with her  bare feet treading the smooth stones the path.    *       *       *       *       *
