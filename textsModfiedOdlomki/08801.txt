meant to remain so. Mr. Scroope exclaimed that she might so far as he  was concerned. She answered that she never wished to see his face again.  He declared with emphasis that she never should and that he was going to  Africa to shoot elephants.    What is more, he went, starting from his Essex home the next day without  leaving any address. As it transpired afterwards, long afterwards, had  he waited till the post came in he would have received a letter that  might have changed his plans. But they were high-spirited young people,  both of them, and played the fool after the fashion of those in love.    Well, Charles Scroope turned up in Durban, which was but a poor place  then, and there we met in the bar of the Royal Hotel.    “If you want to kill big game,” I heard some one say, who it was  I really forget, “there’s the man to show you how to do it--Hunter  Quatermain; the best shot in Africa and one of the finest fellows, too.”    I sat still, smoking my pipe and pretending to hear nothing. It is  awkward to listen to oneself being praised, and I was always a shy man.    Then after a whispered colloquy Mr. Scroope was brought forward and  introduced to me. I bowed as nicely as I could and ran my eye over him.  He was a tall young man with dark eyes and a rather romantic aspect  (that was due to his love affair), but I came to the conclusion that I  liked the cut of his jib. When he spoke, that conclusion was affirmed. I  always think there is a great deal in a voice; personally, I judge by it  almost as much as by the face. This voice was particularly pleasant and  sympathetic, though there was nothing very original or striking in the  words by which it was, so to speak, introduced to me. These were:    “How do you do, sir. Will you have a split?”    I answered that I never drank spirits in the daytime, or at least not  often, but that I should be pleased to take a small bottle of beer.
