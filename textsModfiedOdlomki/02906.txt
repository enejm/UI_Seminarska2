 prison; was crawling over what I suppose were, to him, great uneven  blocks of red and green and black moss.    He crossed from a red into a black patch as I watched his movements  through the glass, and I could see him more plainly against the darker  background. He stopped and picked at the substance of his strange  surroundings, then straightened to examine a tuft of the cloth. The  magnifier enlarged him to a seeming half inch or so, and I could see  better, now, this strange tiny creature.    It _was_ a metal cap he wore, and it did have protruding knobs--two of  them--slanting at 45 degree angles from his temples like horns. I  wondered at their use, but it was impossible for me to imagine. Perhaps  they covered some actual growth; he might have had real horns for all I  knew. Nothing would have been too strange to expect.    His clothing showed up as a simple, white, one piece garment, like a  shirt and gym shorts. The shorts ended at the knee, and from there down  he was bare except for a covering on his feet which appeared more like  gloves than shoes. Whatever he wore to protect his feet, it allowed free  movement of his toes.    It struck me that this little man's native habitat must have been very  warm. His attire suggested this. For a moment I considered plugging in  my small heater; my room certainly had no tropical or sub-tropical  temperature at that time of the morning--and how was I to know whether  he shivered when he felt chill. Maybe he blew his horns. Anyway, I  figured a living Eighth Wonder would be more valuable than a dead one;  and I didn't think he could be stuffed. But somehow I forgot it in my  interest in examining this unusual personage.    The little man had dropped the cloth now, and was staring in my  direction. Of course, "my direction" was very general to him; but he  seemed to be conscious of me. He certainly impressed _me_ as being  awfully different, but what his reactions were, I didn't know.    But someone else knew.
