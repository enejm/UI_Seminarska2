 and I warn you to set no foot within its temples.”    “Which your mistress said that we should never reach,” I commented, but  Leo only answered--“We thank you for your warning,” and added, “Horace,  watch them while I saddle the horse, lest they do us a mischief.”    So I took the spear in my uninjured hand and stood ready. But they made  no attempt to hurt us, only fell back a little and began to talk in  hurried whispers. It was evident to me that they were much perturbed.  In a few minutes the horse was saddled and Leo assisted me to mount it.  Then he said--“We go to accomplish our fate, whatever it may be, but  before we part, Khania, I thank you for the kindness you have shown us,  and pray you to be wise and forget that we have ever been. Through no  will of mine your husband’s blood is on my hands, and that alone must  separate us for ever. We are divided by the doors of death and destiny.  Go back to your people, and pardon me if most unwillingly I have brought  you doubt and trouble. Farewell.”    She listened with bowed head, then replied, very sadly--“I thank you for  your gentle words, but, Leo Vincey, we do not part thus easily. You have  summoned me to the Mountain, and even to the Mountain I shall follow  you. Aye, and there I will meet its Spirit, as I have always known I  must and as the Shaman here has always known I must. Yes, I will match  my strength and magic against hers, as it is decreed that I shall do. To  the victor be that crown for which we have warred for ages.”    Then suddenly Atene sprang to her saddle, and turning her horse’s head  rode it back through the water to the shore, followed by old Simbri, who  lifted up his crooked hands as though in woe and fear, muttering as he  went--“You have entered the forbidden river and now, Atene, the day of  decision is upon us all--upon us and her--that predestined day of ruin  and of war.”    “What do they mean?” asked Leo of me.
