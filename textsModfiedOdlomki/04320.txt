common use. Anyway, we've had transcripts of a good many broadcasts  from Incognita, the last dated four days ago; and as far as we can  tell they're interpreting _Gilgamesh_ just as we meant them to.    "The missile, by the way, was experimental, waiting to be test-fired  the next day. The man in charge saw _Gilgamesh_ on the alarm screens  and got trigger-happy. The newscasters were divided as to whether he  should be blamed or praised; they all seem to feel he averted a  menace, at least temporarily, but some of them think the invaders  could have been captured alive.    "The first people on the scene came from a scientific camp; you and  Miss Laydon saw their lights on the way down. You remember that area  is geophysically interesting? Well, by extraordinary good luck an  international group was there studying it. They rushed straight off to  the site of the landing--they actually saw _Gilgamesh_, and she  registered on some of their astronomical instruments, too. They must  be a reckless lot. What's more, they started trying to locate her on  the sea bottom the next day. Found both pieces; they're still trying  to locate the nose. They were all set to try raising the smaller piece  when their governments both announced in some haste that they were  sending a properly equipped expedition. Jointly.    "There's been no mention in any newscast of anyone seeing fairies or  sea maidens--I expect the poor devil thinks you were a hallucination."    So we brought it off.    *       *       *       *       *    I am very thankful in a distant sort of way, but right now the  Incognitans have no more reality for me than the Lost Kafoozalum.    M'Clare came through alive.    I could spend a good deal of time just getting used to that fact, but  there is something I ought to say and I don't know how.    I inquire after his injuries and learn they are healing nicely.
