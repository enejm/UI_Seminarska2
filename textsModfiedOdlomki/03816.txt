 "We need lawyers," Wurpz says.    We cross a thin gangplank and enter the sub. The lights in it are  indirect and are purplish green. Hitler Number Three shows us the  telepathic machine, the radar, and the viso-screen that pictures  everything going on upstairs on Earth, and on Mars, Jupiter and all  other planets. There are four other beetleheads on the sub and they  carry disintegrators.    "These Subterro U-boats," our genial host brags, "can go as fast in  reverse as full speed ahead, as the situation warrants.
