"Oh, oh," gasped Mater.    Her spouse gave her up. "JUNIOR!" he roared in a voice that loosened  the coral along the reef.    *       *       *       *       *    Round about, the couple's bereavement had begun attracting attention.  In the thickening dusk, tentacles paused from winnowing the sea for  their owners' suppers, stalked heads turned curiously here and there in  the colony. Not far away, a threesome of maiden aunts, rooted en brosse  to a single substantial boulder, twittered condolences and watched  Mater avidly.    "Discipline!" growled Pater. "That's what he needs! Just wait till I--"    "Now, dear--" began Mater shakily.    "Hi, folks!" piped Junior from overhead.    His parents swiveled as if on a single stalk. Their offspring was  floating a few fathoms above them, paddling lazily against the ebb;  plainly he had just swum from some crevice in the reef nearby. In one  pair of dangling tentacles he absently hugged a roundish stone, worn  sensuously smooth by pounding surf.    "WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?"    "Nowhere," said Junior innocently. "Just playing hide-and-go-sink with  the squids."    "With the other polyps," Mater corrected him primly. She detested slang.    Pater was eyeing Junior with ominous calm. "And where," he asked, "did  you get that stone?"    Junior contracted guiltily. The surfstone slipped from his tentacles  and plumped to the sea-floor in a flurry of sand. He edged away,  stammering, "Well, I guess maybe ... I might have gone a little ways  toward the beach...."    "You guess! When I was a polyp," said Pater, "the small fry obeyed  their elders, and no guess about it!"    "Now, dear--" said Mater.    "And no spawn of mine," Pater warmed to his lecture, "is going to flout  my words! Junior--COME HERE!"    Junior paddled cautiously around the homesite, just out of  tentacle-reach. He said in a small voice, "I won't."    "DID YOU HEAR ME?"
