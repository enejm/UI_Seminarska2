"Behind the salt."    "What did you find there?"    "Two chocolate grahams."    Bobby held out his hand, accepted one of the crackers without thanks  and proceeded to crumble the whole thing into his concoction, not even  stopping to lick the chocolate off his hands.    Bonnie frowned in disbelief. She had never seen such self-sacrifice.  The act made her aware, for the first time, of the immense  significance of the experiment.    She dropped her quarrel completely and walked over to the sink to get  a good look at what was being done. All she saw in the sink was a  wadded, wet Corn Flake box, the empty sardine tin and spillings from  the juicer, which by this time was beginning to take on a distinctive  and unpleasant odor. Bob gave Bonnie the job of adding seven pinches of  salt and some cocoa to the concoction.    "What's it going to be, Bob?" she asked, blending the cocoa on her  hands into her yellow corduroy skirt.    "Stuff," Bob answered, unbending a little.    "Government stuff?"    "Nope."    "Spaceship stuff?"    "Nope."    "Medicine?"    "Nope."    "I give up."    "It's animal serum," Bob said, sliced his thumb on the sardine can,  glanced unemotionally at the cut, ignored it.    "What's animal serum, Bob?"    "It's certain properties without which the universe in eternity regards  for human beings."    "Oh," Bonnie said. She took off her apron and sat down at the other end  of the kitchen. The smell from the juicer was beginning to reach her  stomach.    Bobby combed the kitchen for something else to throw into his  concoction and came up with some oregano and liquid garlic.    "I guess this is about it," he said.    He poured the garlic and oregano into his juicer, put the lid on, shook  it furiously for a minute and then emptied the contents into a deep pot.    "What are you doing now, Bob?" Bonnie asked.    "You have to cook it for seven minutes."
