"Yes." Leithgow answered. "But, Carse--one question I must ask--"    The Hawk, already halfway to the door in the opposite wall of the  laboratory, paused and looked back inquiringly.    "What bodies are to be used?"    "The only ones available, Eliot," the adventurer replied, "since Ku  Sui, in his attempt to destroy the brains, left us only two hours--now  one hour--to complete the first steps of the transfer. They'll be  those four white assistants of his--those men, you remember, whose  intellects he's dehumanized--"    "Yes, yes?" Leithgow pressed him eagerly. "And the fifth?"    "A robot coolie."

It was a vast place, occupying most of the hollowed-out space of the  hill. Seventy feet high and more than two hundred feet long, it was,  and, like the rest of the rooms, metal-walled and sound-proofed. Eliot  Leithgow's own personal space-ship, the _Sandra_, rested there on its  mooring cradle, and by its side was the laboratory's air-car, an  identical shape in miniature, designed for atmospheric transit.    The adventurer, a silent, swift figure, went straight to the air-car  and climbed into its control seat. He tested the controls, found them  responsive, then pressed a button set apart from the others: and the
