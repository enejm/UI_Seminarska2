 There was an ironic humor in the situation, but Nanlo was not disposed  to recognize it. Lenient as the law was, yet it required some grounds  before it could free her. And she had no grounds whatever. Negu Mah was  at all times the model of courtesy and consideration toward her. He  granted every reasonable wish and some that were unreasonable--although  when he refused one of the latter, it was with a firmness as  unshakeable as a rock.    Their home was as fine as any on earth. She had more than adequate help  in taking care of it. She had ample time for any pursuits that  interested her. But she used it only to become more and more bitter  against Negu Mah because she could find no excuse to divorce him.    So great had her bitterness become that, if she could have gotten off  Callisto in any way, she would have deserted him. This would have meant  forfeiting her marriage settlement and the sum that was in escrow. It  would also have left her father in debt to Negu Mah for all that Negu  Mah had given him. But Nanlo's passionate rebellion had reached such a  state of ferment in her breast that she would have accepted all this to  strike a blow at the plump, smiling man who now sat drinking molkai in  their garden with their guest from Venus.    The answer to that was--Negu Mah would not let her leave Callisto. The  journey to earth, he logically argued, was still one containing a large  element of danger. There was no reason for her to visit any other  planet, and law and custom required that she look after their home  while he himself was away on business.    In this he was unshakeable. There was a stern and unyielding side to  him, inherited perhaps from his Eastern ancestors, that left Nanlo  shaken and frightened when it appeared. She had seen it the one time  she had seriously gone into a tantrum in an effort to make him let her  take a trip to earth. It had so startled and terrified her that she had  never used those tactics again.
