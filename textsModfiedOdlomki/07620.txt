 “Your companion!” cried d’Artagnan, becoming more pale than the white  veil of his mistress. “Of what companion are you speaking, dear  Constance?”    “Of her whose carriage was at the gate; of a woman who calls herself  your friend; of a woman to whom you have told everything.”    “Her name, her name!” cried d’Artagnan. “My God, can you not remember  her name?”    “Yes, it was pronounced in my hearing once. Stop--but--it is very  strange--oh, my God, my head swims! I cannot see!”    “Help, help, my friends! her hands are icy cold,” cried d’Artagnan. “She  is ill! Great God, she is losing her senses!”    While Porthos was calling for help with all the power of his strong  voice, Aramis ran to the table to get a glass of water; but he stopped  at seeing the horrible alteration that had taken place in the  countenance of Athos, who, standing before the table, his hair rising  from his head, his eyes fixed in stupor, was looking at one of the  glasses, and appeared a prey to the most horrible doubt.    “Oh!” said Athos, “oh, no, it is impossible! God would not permit such a  crime!”    “Water, water!” cried d’Artagnan. “Water!”    “Oh, poor woman, poor woman!” murmured Athos, in a broken voice.    Mme. Bonacieux opened her eyes under the kisses of d’Artagnan.    “She revives!” cried the young man. “Oh, my God, my God, I thank thee!”    “Madame!” said Athos, “madame, in the name of heaven, whose empty glass  is this?”    “Mine, monsieur,” said the young woman, in a dying voice.    “But who poured the wine for you that was in this glass?”    “She.”    “But who is SHE?”    “Oh, I remember!” said Mme. Bonacieux, “the Comtesse de Winter.”    The four friends uttered one and the same cry, but that of Athos  dominated all the rest.    At that moment the countenance of Mme. Bonacieux became livid; a fearful  agony pervaded her frame, and she sank panting into the arms of Porthos  and Aramis.
