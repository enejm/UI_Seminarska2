   "How'd you happen to join the Navy, if I may make so bold?"    "Gosh, that's hard to say. But I guess mostly I felt so crowded at  home. So, pigeonholed. The world seemed to be nothing but neat little  pigeonholes."    "Uh-huh. Same here. I was also a square pigeon in a round hole." She  laughed. "Luckily," he added, "Space is too big for compartments."    Her agreement lacked vigor. The Navy must have been a disappointment  to her. But she couldn't very well say so in front of her shipmates.    Hm-m-m ... if she could be gotten away from them--"How long will you  be here?" he inquired. His pulse thuttered.    "We haven't been told," she said.    "Some work must be done on the missile launchers," Warburton said.  "That's best carried out here, where extra facilities are available if  we need them. Not that I expect we will." He paused. "I hope we won't  interfere with your own operations."    "Far from it." Blades beamed at Ellen. "Or, more accurately, this kind  of interference I don't mind in the least."    She blushed and her eyelids fluttered. Not that she was a fluffhead,  he realized. But to avoid incidents, Navy regulations enforced an  inhuman correctness between personnel of opposite sexes. After weeks  in the black, meeting a man who could pay a compliment without risking  court-martial must be like a shot of adrenalin. Better and better!    "Are you sure?" Warburton persisted. "For instance, won't we be in the  way when the next ship comes from Jupiter?"    "She'll approach the opposite end of the asteroid," Blades said.  "Won't stay long, either."    "How long?"    "One watch, so the crew can relax a bit among those of us who're off  duty. It'd be a trifle longer if we didn't happen to have an empty bag  at the moment. But never very long. Even running under thrust the  whole distance, Jupe's a good ways off. They've no time to waste."    "When is the next ship due?"    "The _Pallas Castle_ is expected in the second watch from now."
