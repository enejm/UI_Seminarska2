to the walls, the breeze carried to their ears the sound of music--dim  at first, but growing louder as they advanced.    "That doesn't seem like a very terr'ble place," remarked Dorothy.    "Well, it LOOKS all right," replied Trot from her seat on the Woozy,  "but looks can't always be trusted."    "MY looks can," said Scraps.  "I LOOK patchwork, and I AM patchwork,  and no one but a blind owl could ever doubt that I'm the Patchwork  Girl."  Saying which, she turned a somersault off the Woozy and,  alighting on her feet, began wildly dancing about.    "Are owls ever blind?" asked Trot.    "Always, in the daytime," said Button-Bright.

"Then how does it happen--"    "Never mind," interrupted the Wizard, "we are no farther from it than  we were before.  It is in a different direction, that's all, so let us
