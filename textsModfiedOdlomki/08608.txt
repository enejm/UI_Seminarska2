not kill a buck for supper. I was too weak to go myself.    “Meanwhile Mashune employed himself in dragging together some dead  boughs from the mimosa trees to make a sort of ‘skerm,’ or shelter for  us to sleep in, about forty yards from the edge of the pool of water.  We had been greatly troubled with lions in the course of our long tramp,  and only on the previous night have very nearly been attacked by them,  which made me nervous, especially in my weak state. Just as we had  finished the skerm, or rather something which did duty for one, Mashune  and I heard a shot apparently fired about a mile away.    “‘Hark to it!’ sung out Mashune in Zulu, more, I fancy, by way of  keeping his spirits up than for any other reason--for he was a sort of  black Mark Tapley, and very cheerful under difficulties. ‘Hark to the  wonderful sound with which the “Maboona” (the Boers) shook our fathers  to the ground at the Battle of the Blood River. We are hungry now, my  father; our stomachs are small and withered up like a dried ox’s paunch,  but they will soon be full of good meat. Hans is a Hottentot, and an  “umfagozan,” that is, a low fellow, but he shoots straight--ah! he  certainly shoots straight. Be of a good heart, my father, there will  soon be meat upon the fire, and we shall rise up men.’    “And so he went on talking nonsense till I told him to stop, because he  made my head ache with his empty words.    “Shortly after we heard the shot the sun sank in his red splendour, and  there fell upon earth and sky the great hush of the African wilderness.  The lions were not up as yet, they would probably wait for the moon, and  the birds and beasts were all at rest. I cannot describe the intensity  of the quiet of the night: to me in my weak state, and fretting as I was  over the non-return of the Hottentot Hans, it seemed almost ominous--as  though Nature were brooding over some tragedy which was being enacted in  her sight.
