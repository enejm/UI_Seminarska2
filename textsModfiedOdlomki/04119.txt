"Agg--" she sobbed, "agg--agg--aggravation." She began to bawl in  earnest. "Now he's gone. He's mad. He won't ever come back, I betcha."    "That's a fact," I muttered. "He may not have been mad, but he certainly  was aggravated. Marge, listen! This is a mystery. We've just got to let  it stay a mystery. We don't know anything, understand? The cops will  finally decide Elmer blew himself up, and we'll leave it at that. One  thing I'm pretty sure about--he's not coming back."    *       *       *       *       *    So that's how it was. Tom Kennedy keeps trying and trying to put Elmer's  unhappen genii back together again. And every time he fails he takes it  out on me because I didn't get to Elmer sooner. But you can see  perfectly well he's way off base, trying to make out I could have done a  thing to prevent what happened.    Is it my fault if the dumb kid didn't know enough to take the proper  precautions when he decided to develop anti-gravitation--and got shot  off, garage and all, someplace into outer space?    What do they teach kids nowadays, anyway?    --ROBERT ARTHUR          Transcriber's Note:    This etext was produced from _Galaxy Science Fiction_ May 1955.
