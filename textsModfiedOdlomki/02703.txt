dark. Within the control room Walter Harkness grinned happily as he  drew his bruised body from the place where he had been thrown, and  brought the ship to an even keel.    *       *       *       *       *    Nice work! But there was other work ahead, and the smile of  satisfaction soon passed. He held the nose up, and the wireless  warning went out before as the wild climb kept on.    Forty thousand was passed; then fifty and more; a hundred thousand;  and at length he was through the repelling area, that zone of  mysterious force, above which was a magnetic repulsion nearly  neutralizing gravity. He could fly level now; every unit of force  could be used for forward flight to hurl him onward faster and faster  into the night.    Harkness was flying where his license was void; he was flying, too,  where all aircraft were banned. But the rules of the Board of Control  meant nothing to him this night. Nor did the voluble and sulphurous  orders to halt that a patrol-ship flashed north. The patrol-ship was  on station; she was lost far astern before she could gather speed for  pursuit.    Walter Harkness had caught his position upon a small chart. It was a  sphere, and he led a thin wire from the point that was Vienna to a dot  that he marked on the sub-polar waste. He dropped a slender pointer  upon the wire and engaged its grooved tip, and then the flying was out  of his hands. The instrument before him, with its light bulbs and  swift moving discs, would count their speed of passage; it would hold  the ship steadily upon an unerring course and allow for drift of  winds. The great-circle course was simple; the point he marked was  drawing them as if it had been a magnet--drawing them as it drew the  eyes of Walt Harkness, staring strainingly ahead as if to span the  thousands of miles of dark.
