Carefully avoiding brass plates, Dan made his way along an avenue of  shops devoted to exercise and physical fitness. He came to Runfast  Blvd. and located 6140, which looked like the apartment houses he had  seen earlier.    He tried the outer door; it was locked. When someone came out, Dan  caught the door and stepped in. As the door shut, he tried it and found  it was locked again. He stood for a moment trying to understand it, but  his sleeplessness of the night before was catching up with him. He gave  up and went inside.    There were no elevators on the ground floor.
