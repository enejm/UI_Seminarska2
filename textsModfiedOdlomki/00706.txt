 "That's where you're to help me," said Dorothy.  "In some of those wild  forests in the Gillikin Country are lots of monkeys."    "Big ones," said the Wizard.    "Well, you and I will go there, and we'll get some of the big monkeys,  and you will make them small--just three inches high--by means of your  magic, and we'll put the little monkeys all in a basket and bring them  home with us.  Then you'll train them to dance--up here in your room,  where no one can see them--and on Ozma's birthday we'll put 'em into  the cake and they'll know by that time just what to do."

"I'm ready to go any time," agreed Dorothy.  "Shall we ask Ozma to let  us take the Sawhorse?"    The Wizard did not answer that at once.  He took time to think of the  suggestion.    "No," he answered at length, "the Red Wagon couldn't get through the  thick forests and there's some danger to us in going into the wild  places to search for monkeys.  So I propose we take the Cowardly Lion
