  I got back into my own framework of temporal reference, so to speak, and  began explaining to a Zen what a Zen was. (I found out later from Yurt  that biology, for the reasons which follow, was one of the most  difficult studies; so difficult that nuclear physics actually _preceded_  it!) I told her that the Zen had been, all evidence indicated, the  toughest, hardest, longest-lived creatures God had ever cooked up:  practically independent of their environment, no special ecological  niche; just raw, stubborn, tenacious life, developed to a fantastic  extreme--a greater force of life than any other known, one that could  exist almost anywhere under practically any conditions--even floating in  midspace, which, asteroid or no, this Zen was doing right now.    The Zens breathed, all right, but it was nothing they'd had to do in  order to live. It gave them nothing their incredible metabolism couldn't  scrounge up out of rock or cosmic rays or interstellar gas or simply do  without for a few thousand years. If the human body is a furnace, then  the Zen body is a feeder pile. Maybe that, I thought, was what evolution  always worked toward.    "Please, will you kill me?" the Zen said.    *       *       *       *       *    I'd been expecting that. Two years ago, on the bleak surface of Eros,  Yurt had asked Engstrom to do the same thing. But I asked, "Why?"  although I knew what the answer would be, too.    The Zen looked up at me.

A tiny motion here, a quiver there, but very quiet and  still for the most part. And _that_ was the violent expression:  restraint. Yurt, after two years of living with us, still couldn't  understand why we found this confusing.    Difficult, aliens--or being alien.    "I've tried so often to do it myself," the Zen said softly.
