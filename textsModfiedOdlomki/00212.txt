"No," returned Dorothy, stoutly, "it won't do to go back, for then we  would never get home. Let's fight it out."    "That is what I advise," said the Wizard. "They haven't defeated us yet,  and Jim is worth a whole army."    But the Gargoyles were clever enough not to attack the horse the next  time. They advanced in a great swarm, having been joined by many more of  their kind, and they flew straight over Jim's head to where the others  were standing.
