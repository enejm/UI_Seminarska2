 The old man shook his head slowly, smiling. "I'm afraid I wouldn't make  a passing grade. I didn't know, or at least didn't realize, that. One of  the things I'm going to place an order for, to be brought on the  _Schiaparelli_, will be a set of primers in chemistry and physics, of  the sort intended for a bright child of ten or twelve. It seems that a  Martiologist has to learn a lot of things the Hittites and the Assyrians  never heard about."    Tony Lattimer, coming in, caught the last part of the explanation. He  looked quickly at the walls and, having found out just what had  happened, advanced and caught Martha by the hand.    "You really did it, Martha! You found your bilingual! I never believed  that it would be possible; let me congratulate you!"    He probably expected that to erase all the jibes and sneers of the past.  If he did, he could have it that way. His friendship would mean as  little to her as his derision--except that his friends had to watch  their backs and his knife. But he was going home on the _Cyrano_, to be  a big shot. Or had this changed his mind for him again?    "This is something we can show the world, to justify any expenditure of  time and money on Martian archaeological work. When I get back to Terra,  I'll see that you're given full credit for this achievement--"    On Terra, her back and his knife would be out of her watchfulness.    "We won't need to wait that long," Hubert Penrose told him dryly. "I'm  sending off an official report, tomorrow; you can be sure Dr. Dane will  be given full credit, not only for this but for her previous work,  which made it possible to exploit this discovery."    "And you might add, work done in spite of the doubts and discouragements  of her colleagues," Selim von Ohlmhorst said. "To which I am ashamed to  have to confess my own share."    "You said we had to find a bilingual," she said. "You were right, too."    "This is better than a bilingual, Martha," Hubert Penrose said.
