It was not the safety of his own skin that troubled him, but the  success of the scheme he had planned.  That little man was clean grit  all through, without a soft spot in him.  One night he was very solemn.    'Say, Hannay,' he said, 'I judge I should let you a bit deeper into  this business.  I should hate to go out without leaving somebody else  to put up a fight.'  And he began to tell me in detail what I had only  heard from him vaguely.    I did not give him very close attention.  The fact is, I was more  interested in his own adventures than in his high politics.  I reckoned  that Karolides and his affairs were not my business, leaving all that  to him.  So a lot that he said slipped clean out of my memory.  I  remember that he was very clear that the danger to Karolides would not  begin till he had got to London, and would come from the very highest  quarters, where there would be no thought of suspicion.  He mentioned  the name of a woman--Julia Czechenyi--as having something to do with  the danger.  She would be the decoy, I gathered, to get Karolides out  of the care of his guards.  He talked, too, about a Black Stone and a  man that lisped in his speech, and he described very particularly  somebody that he never referred to without a shudder--an old man with a  young voice who could hood his eyes like a hawk.    He spoke a good deal about death, too.  He was mortally anxious about  winning through with his job, but he didn't care a rush for his life.    'I reckon it's like going to sleep when you are pretty well tired out,  and waking to find a summer day with the scent of hay coming in at the  window.  I used to thank God for such mornings way back in the  Blue-Grass country, and I guess I'll thank Him when I wake up on the  other side of Jordan.'    Next day he was much more cheerful, and read the life of Stonewall
