promises to be good?" enquired Tip. Jinjur's lip curled scornfully.    "Or give her a good shaking!" added the Saw-Horse.    "No," said the Tin Woodman, "we must treat the poor girl with gentleness.  Let us give her all the Jewels she can carry, and send her away happy and  contented."        175    At this Queen Jinjur laughed aloud, and the next minute clapped her pretty  hands together thrice, as if for a signal.    "You are very absurd creatures," said she; "but I am tired of your nonsense  and have no time to bother with you longer."    While the monarch and his friends listened in amazement to this impudent  speech, a startling thing happened. The Tin Woodman's axe was snatched from  his grasp by some person behind him, and he found himself disarmed and  helpless. At the same instant a shout of laughter rang in the ears of the  devoted band, and turning to see whence this came they found themselves  surrounded by the Army of Revolt, the girls bearing in either hand their  glistening knitting-needles. The entire throne room seemed to be filled with  the rebels, and the Scarecrow and his comrades realized that they were  prisoners.    "You see how foolish it is to oppose a woman's wit," said Jinjur, gaily;  "and this event only proves that I am more fit to rule the Emerald City than  a Scarecrow. I bear you no ill will, I assure you; but lest you should prove  troublesome to me in the future I shall order you all to be destroyed. That  is, all except the boy, who belongs to old Mombi and must be restored to her  keeping. The rest of        176  you are not human, and therefore it will not be wicked to demolish you. The  Saw-Horse and the Pumpkinhead's body I will have chopped up for kindling-  wood; and the pumpkin shall be made into tarts. The Scarecrow will do nicely  to start a bonfire, and the tin man can be cut into small pieces and fed to  the goats. As for this immense Woggle-Bug--"    "Highly Magnified, if you please!" interrupted the insect.
