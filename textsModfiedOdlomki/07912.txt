 awaited; but with a view of insuring the execution of this order in a  royal manner, one last question was necessary, and Louis XIV. put it to  the two gentlemen in the following manner:--“Have you any money?”    “Sire,” replied Saint-Aignan, “we have arranged everything with M.  Colbert.”    “Ah! very well!”    “Yes, sire, and M. Colbert said he would wait upon your majesty, as  soon as your majesty should manifest an intention of carrying out the  _fetes_, of which he has furnished the programme.”    “Let him come in, then,” said the king; and as if Colbert had been  listening at the door for the purpose of keeping himself _au courant_  with the conversation, he entered as soon as the king had pronounced his  name to the two courtiers.    “Ah! M. Colbert,” said the king. “Gentlemen, to your posts,” whereupon  Saint-Aignan and Villeroy took their leave. The king seated himself in  an easy-chair near the window, saying: “The ballet will take place this  evening, M. Colbert.”    “In that case, sire, I will pay all accounts to-morrow.”    “Why so?”    “I promised the tradespeople to pay their bills the day following that  on which the ballet should take place.”    “Very well, M. Colbert, pay them, since you have promised to do so.”    “Certainly, sire; but I must have money to do that.”    “What! have not the four millions, which M. Fouquet promised, been sent?  I forgot to ask you about it.”    “Sire, they were sent at the hour promised.”    “Well?”    “Well, sire, the colored lamps, the fireworks, the musicians, and the  cooks, have swallowed up four millions in eight days.”    “Entirely?”    “To the last penny. Every time your majesty directed the banks of the  grand canal to be illuminated, as much oil was consumed as there was  water in the basins.”    “Well, well, M. Colbert; the fact is, then, you have no more money?”    “I have no more, sire, but M. Fouquet has,” Colbert replied, his face  darkening with a sinister expression of pleasure.
