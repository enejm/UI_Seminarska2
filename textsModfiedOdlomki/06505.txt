There were two columns about the Portland Place Murder, as it was  called.  My man Paddock had given the alarm and had the milkman  arrested.  Poor devil, it looked as if the latter had earned his  sovereign hardly; but for me he had been cheap at the price, for he  seemed to have occupied the police for the better part of the day.  In  the latest news I found a further instalment of the story.
