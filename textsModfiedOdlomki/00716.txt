 upon the ground.    The Wizard picked up the magic axe and after carefully wiping it with  his silk handkerchief put it away in his black bag.  Then they went on  and in a short time reached the river.    "Let me see," said the Glass Cat, looking up and down the stream, "I  think we are below the Magic Isle; so we must go up the stream until we  come to it."    So up the stream they traveled, walking comfortably on the river bank,  and after a while the water broadened and a sharp bend appeared in the  river, hiding all below from their view.  They walked briskly along,  however, and had nearly reached the bend when a voice cried warningly:  "Look out!"    The travelers halted abruptly and the Wizard said: "Look out for what?"    "You almost stepped on my Diamond Palace," replied the voice, and a  duck with gorgeously colored feathers appeared before them.  "Beasts  and men are terribly clumsy," continued the Duck in an irritated tone,  "and you've no business on this side of the River, anyway.  What are  you doing here?"    "We've come to rescue some friends of ours who are stuck fast on the  Magic Isle in this river," explained Dorothy.    "I know 'em," said the Duck.  "I've been to see 'em, and they're stuck  fast, all right.  You may as well go back home, for no power can save  them."    "This is the Wonderful Wizard of Oz," said Dorothy, pointing to the  little man.    "Well, I'm the Lonesome Duck," was the reply, as the fowl strutted up  and down to show its feathers to best advantage.  "I'm the great Forest  Magician, as any beast can tell you, but even I have no power to  destroy the dreadful charm of the Magic Isle."    "Are you lonesome because you're a magician?" inquired Dorothy.    "No; I'm lonesome because I have no family and no friends.  But I like  to be lonesome, so please don't offer to be friendly with me.  Go away,  and try not to step on my Diamond Palace."
