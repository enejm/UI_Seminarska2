hell! There's no chance left! Just this poison that used to be air,  and those things outside, watching, watching, waiting--waiting for us  to leave--waiting to get us all! Waiting...."    "Something's up!" said Ken Torrance suddenly. "They've got tired of  waiting!"          CHAPTER V    _The Last Assault_      Sallorsen turned his head and followed the torpooner's intent, amazed  gaze.    Ken said:    "There's proof of their intelligence! I've been watching--didn't  realize at first. Look, here it comes!"    Several sealmen, while Sallorsen had been talking, had come dropping  down from the main mass of the horde, and had grouped around the  abandoned torpoon which lay some feet ahead of the submarine's bow.  Expertly they had loosened the seaweed-ropes which bound it to the  sea-floor, then slid back, watching alertly, as if expecting the  torpoon to speed away of its own accord. Its batteries, of course, had  worn out weeks before, so the steel shell did net budge. The sealmen  came down close to it again, and lifted it.    They lifted it easily with their prehensile flipper-arms, and with  maneuvering of delicate sureness guided it through the gash in the  _Peary's_ bow. Inside, they hesitated with it, midway between deck and  ceiling of the flooded compartment. They poised for perhaps a full  minute, judging the distance, while the two men stared; and then  quickly their powerful tail flippers lashed out and the torpoon jumped  ahead. It sped straight through the water, to crash its tough nose of  steel squarely into the quarsteel pane of the watertight door, then  rebounded, and fell to the deck.    "My God!" gasped Sallorsen. But Ken wasted no words then. He pressed  closer to the quarsteel and examined it minutely. The substance showed  no visible effect, but the action of the sealmen destroyed whatever  hope he had felt.    The sealmen had swerved aside at the last minute; and now, picking up  the torpoon again and guiding it back to the other end of the  compartment, they hurled it once more with a resounding crash into the  quarsteel pane.
