never see us again."    Nanlo leaned against his shoulder, the prospect that he painted seemed  very sweet to her.    "You're sure you can manage the ship alone?" she asked. "But of course,  I can help, a little anyway. You can teach me."    "Of course," Hugh Neils answered confidently, and bent to kiss her  again. "I've been studying her for a week, asking questions, making  friends with the crew. I can handle her one-handed. We'll take off and  circle Jupiter first. They may think we landed on the other side, in  the Outlaw Crevice. Or they may figure that we went on to Saturn, and  will hide somewhere in the system there.
