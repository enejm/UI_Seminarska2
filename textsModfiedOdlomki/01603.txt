  That airplane of the slanted wings, the bulbous, almost bulletlike  fuselage, what of it? It was simple, as Kleig looked back at his  memoried glimpse of it. The submarine was a metal fish made with human  hands; the airplane aped the birds. The strange ship which had caused  the destruction of the _Stellar_, was a combination fish and bird--which  merely aped nature a bit further, as anyone who had ever traversed  tropical waters would have instantly recognized.    But what did it portend? What ghastly terrors of Moyen roamed the deeps  of the Atlantic, of the Pacific, the oceans of the world? How close  were some of these to the United States?    The pale eyes of Moyen, he was sure, were already turned toward the  West.    *       *       *       *       *    Prester Kleig sighed as he seated himself beside Carlos Kane. Then Kane  pressed one of the myriad of buttons on the dash, and Kleig lifted his  eyes to peer through the skylight, to where that single press of a  button had set in motion the intricate machinery of the helicopter.    A four-bladed fan lifted on a slender pedestal, sufficiently high above  the surface of the wing for the vanes to be free of the central  propeller. Then, automatically, the vanes became invisible, and the  Mayther lifted from the sandy beach as lightly, and far more straightly,  than any bird.    As the ship climbed away for the skies, and through the transparent  floor the beach and the Atlantic fell away below the ship, a sigh of  relief escaped Kleig. This was living! Up here one was free, if only for  a moment, and the swift wind of flight brushed all cobwebs from the  tired human brain. He watched the slender needle of the altimeter, as it  moved around the face of the dial as steadily as the hands of a clock,  around to thirty thousand, thirty-five, forty.    Then Carlos Kane, every movement as effortless as the flight of the
