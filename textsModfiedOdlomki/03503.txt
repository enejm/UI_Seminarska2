  He sprawled there for a while, his bruised body refusing movement. A  weary sailor with a bucket glared at him through dripping hair. His  shout was dim under the hoot and skirl of wind: "If ye like it so well  down here, then help us bail!"    "'Tis not yet my turn," groaned Cappen, and got slowly up.    The wave which had nearly swamped them had put out the ship's fire and  drenched the wood beyond hope of lighting a new one. It was cold fish  and sea-sodden hardtack till they saw land again--if they ever did.    As Cappen raised himself on the leeward side, he thought he saw  something gleam, far out across the wrathful night. A wavering red  spark-- He brushed a stiffened hand across his eyes, wondering if the  madness of wind and water had struck through into his own skull. A gust  of sleet hid it again. But--    He fumbled his way aft between the benches. Huddled figures cursed him  wearily as he stepped on them. The ship shook herself, rolled along the  edge of a boiling black trough, and slid down into it; for an instant,  the white teeth of combers grinned above her rail, and Cappen waited for  an end to all things. Then she mounted them again, somehow, and wallowed  toward another valley.    King Svearek had the steering oar and was trying to hold the longboat  into the wind. He had stood there since sundown, huge and untiring, legs  braced and the bucking wood cradled in his arms. More than human he  seemed, there under the icicle loom of the stern-post, his gray hair and  beard rigid with ice. Beneath the horned helmet, the strong moody face  turned right and left, peering into the darkness. Cappen felt smaller  than usual when he approached the steersman.    He leaned close to the king, shouting against the blast of winter: "My  lord, did I not see firelight?"    "Aye. I spied it an hour ago," grunted the king. "Been trying to steer  us a little closer to it."    Cappen nodded, too sick and weary to feel reproved. "What is it?"
