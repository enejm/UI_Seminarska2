 personality. Then his arch-enemy, _Schomberg_, lieutenant of reserve,  shady hotel-keeper, sensualist and craven, with his insane malice.  To these enter as pretty a company of miscreants as ever sailed the  Southern seas: the sinister _Jones_, misogynist to the point of fine  frenzy, nonconformist in the matter of card-playing, and thereafter  frank bandit with a high ethic as to the superiority of plain robbery  under arms over mere vulgar swindling--a gentleman with a code, in  fact; his strictly incomparable "secretary," _Ricardo_ of the rolling  eyes and gait and deathly treacherous knife, philogynist _sans  phrase_; and _Pedro_, their groom, a reincarnated _Caliban_. It may  also be noted that _Heyst_ has a freak servant, the disappearing  _Wang_, whom the adapter uses, I suppose legitimately, as a kind of  clown. And then, finally, there is a charming and unusual heroine,  _Lena_, still in her teens, but of real flesh and blood, innocent and  persecuted, daughter of a drunken fiddler (deceased), herself fiddling  in a tenth-rate orchestra at _Schomberg's_ hotel, wherein it is not  intended that the music shall be the chief attraction to the guests.    _Heyst_ is Perseus to _Lena's_ Andromeda, carrying her off to his  island out of lust's way. But dragon _Schomberg_ has a sting left in  his malicious tale, told to the unlikely trio of scoundrels, to the  effect that _Heyst_ has ill-gotten treasure hoarded on his island.  Dragon _Ricardo_ persuades his chief to the adventure of attaching  it. A fine brew of passion and action forsooth: _Lena_ passionately  adoring; the aloof _Heyst_ passing suddenly from indifference to  ardour; the bestial _Ricardo_ in pursuit of his startled quarry; and  gentleman _Jones_ intent on non-existent booty and rapt out of him  self by cynical fury at the discovery of an unsuspected woman in  the case. And while Mr. CONRAD in his novel drives all these to a  relentless doom Mr. HASTINGS contrives a happy ending, which goes  perilously near an anticlimax, with the hero on his knees and the  heroine pointing up to heaven and claiming a "victory" quite other  than their creator intended. But then he knew perfectly well that  nobody wants to come to see Miss MARIE LÖHR killed.    [Illustration: THE LAGGARD LOVER. _Lena_ (Miss MARIE LÖHR) _to Heyst_
