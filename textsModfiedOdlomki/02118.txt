 _By Arthur J. Burks_          CHAPTER XIX    _Desolation_      Stranger, more thrilling even than had been the flight of the Earth  after being forced out of its orbit, was the flight of those dozen  aircars of the Moon, bearing the rebels of Dalis' Gens back to Earth.    [Sidenote: Martian fire-balls and the terrific Moon-cubes wreak  tremendous destruction on helpless Earth in the final death struggle of  the warring worlds.]    For the light which glowed from the bodies of the rebels, which had been  given them by their passage through the white flames, was transmitted to  the cars themselves, so that they glowed as with an inner radiance of  their own--like comets flashing across the night.    Strange alchemy, which Sarka wondered about and, wondering, looked ahead  to the time when he should be able, within his laboratory, to analyze  the force it embodied, and thus gain new scientific knowledge of untold  value to people of the Earth.    As the cars raced across outer darkness, moving at top speed, greater  than ever attained before by man, greater than even these mighty cars  had traveled, Sarka looked ahead, and wondered about the fearful report  his father had just given him.    That there was an alliance between Mars and the Moon seemed almost  unbelievable. How had they managed the first contact, the first  negotiations leading to the compact between two such alien peoples? Had  there been any flights exchanged by the two worlds, surely the  scientists of Earth would have known about it. But there had not, though  there had been times and times when Sarka had peered closely enough at  the surface of both the Moon and of Mars to see the activities, or the  results of the activities, of the peoples of the two worlds.    Somehow, however, communication, if Sarka the Second had guessed  correctly, had been managed between Mars and the Moon; and now that the  Earth was a free flying orb the two were in alliance against it, perhaps  for the same reason that the Earth had gone a-voyaging.    *       *       *       *       *
