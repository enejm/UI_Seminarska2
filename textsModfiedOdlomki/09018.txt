There, standing a few yards away surrounded by some of Zikali's  people, I saw Lost and knew at once that it was an English  Airedale, for I have had several of the breed.  It looked very  tired and frightened, and while I was wondering whence on earth  it could have come, I noticed that it had a silver-mounted collar  and remembered Nombe and her talk about you and a dog that  carried silver on it.
