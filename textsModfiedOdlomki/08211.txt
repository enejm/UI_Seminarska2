slightest swell there is a dull and distant booming of the surge in those  cavernous deeps; and when the wind blows fresh, each roller smites the  cliff like a thunder-clap, till even the living rock trembles again.    It was on a ledge of that rock-face that our cave opened, and sometimes  on a fine day Elzevir would carry me out thither, so that I might sun  myself and see all the moving Channel without myself being seen. For this  ledge was carved out something like a balcony, so that when the quarry  was in working they could lower the stone by pulleys to boats lying  underneath, and perhaps haul up a keg or two by the way of ballast, as  might be guessed by the stanchions still rusting in the rock.    Such was this gallery; and as for the inside of the cave, 'twas a great  empty room, with a white floor made up of broken stone-dust trodden hard  of old till one would say it was plaster; and dry, without those sweaty  damps so often seen in such places--save only in one corner a  land-spring dropped from the roof trickling down over spiky  rock-icicles, and falling into a little hollow in the floor. This basin  had been scooped out of set purpose, with a gutter seaward for the  overflow, and round it and on the wet patch of the roof above grew a  garden of ferns and other clinging plants.
