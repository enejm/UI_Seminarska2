of the Earth lying between Ohi and the North Pole, from the heart of  what had once been part of the Pacific Ocean.    So many of them were there that when they were free of the Earth,  flashing outward at two thousand miles an hour, it was impossible to see  the Moon or those formidable Aircars--and still, out of the heart of the  area of the Gens of Dalis, came other myriads, each flight waiting only  for the preceding flight to clear!
