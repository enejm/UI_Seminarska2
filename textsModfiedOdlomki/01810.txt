made.    "Only that one shot, Gregg?"    Snap's voice was raised over the clang of the workmen bolting the  little gravity-plates of the last platform.    "Four blasts. But just the one projector.

Around his waist was the weighted belt  and there were weights on his shoes for gravity stability.    "Didn't hurt us much."    "No."    "When I get the tube-panels in this thing I'll be finished.
