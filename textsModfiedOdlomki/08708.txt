force that no one can resist, and who, having undertaken, has been  carried through them, triumphing over the shrinkings of his flesh by  some secret reserve of nerve power. Almost am I tempted to call it  spirit-power, something that lives beyond and yet inspires our frail and  fallible bodies.    Well, rarely have I been more frightened than I was at this moment.  Actually I hung back until I saw that Hans slithering through the grass  like a thick yellow snake with the great knife in his right hand,  was quite a foot ahead of me. Then my pride came to the rescue and I  spurted, if one can spurt upon oneâ€™s stomach, and drew level with him.
