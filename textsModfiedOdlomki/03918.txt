"A St. Bernard?" The animal looked disgusted. "I don't want to be no  dog. I want to be a leopard."    "But you're _beautiful_, Bob! Go look in the mirror."    "Naah." The dog paddled over to the table.    "What are you going to do, Bob?"    "I'm going to try it again."    The dog put its front paws on the table, knocked over the serum and  lapped up some as it dripped on the floor. _Pop_ went the serum, taking  effect. Bobby remained on all fours and kept on lapping. _Pop_ went the  serum again.    "What am I now?" he asked.    "You're still a St. Bernard," said Bonnie.    "The devil with it then," said the dog. "Let's forget all about it."    The dog took one last lap of serum. _Pop!_ Bobby got up from the floor  and dejectedly started out the back door. Bonnie skipped after him.    "What'll we do now, Bob?" she asked.    "We'll go down to Thrifty's and get some ice cream."    They walked down the hill silently, Bobby brooding over not having  been a leopard and Bonnie wishing he had stayed a St. Bernard. As they  approached the main street of the small town, Bonnie turned to her  brother.    "You want to make some more of that stuff tomorrow?"    "Not the same stuff," said Bob.    "What'll we make instead?"    "I ain't decided yet."    "You want to make an atomic bomb?"    "Maybe."    "Can we do it in the juicer?"    "Sure," Bob said, "only we'll have to get a couple of onions."
