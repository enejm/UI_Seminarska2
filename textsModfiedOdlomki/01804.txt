  Paula stood up, smiling a little.    "I did not think I lacked courage, Senhor," she observed, "but you  have taught me more."    "_Nil desperandum_," said Bell lightly. He relaxed deliberately.  Matters would be tense at the flying field, and he would need to be  wholly calm. There was little danger of an attempt at rescue here, and  the necessity of being ready to shoot Ribiera at any instant was no  longer a matter of split seconds.
