 had settled into his coasterchair did he notice the presence of the  other 'copter, and then it was too late. Too late to do anything  except sit and stare as the gigantic shadow loomed out of the night,  silhouetted against the sky.    The shadow shambled forward, and Littlejohn gaped, gaped in terror at  the titanic figure. He opened his mouth to speak, but words did not  form; there were no words to form, for how does one address an  apparition?    Instead, it was the apparition which spoke.
