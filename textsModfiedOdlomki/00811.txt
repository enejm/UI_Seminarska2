    "It is but honest that I should acknowledge at the beginning of my recital  that I was born an ordinary Woggle-Bug," began the creature, in a frank and  friendly tone. "Knowing no better, I used my arms as well as my legs for  walking, and crawled under the edges of stones or hid among the roots of  grasses with no thought beyond finding a few insects smaller than myself to  feed upon.    "The chill nights rendered me stiff and motionless, for I wore no clothing,  but each morning the warm rays of the sun gave me new life and restored me  to activity. A horrible existence is this, but you must remember it is the  regular ordained existence of Woggle-Bugs, as well as of many other tiny  creatures that inhabit the earth.    "But Destiny had singled me out, humble though I was, for a grander fate!  One day I crawled near        148  to a country school house, and my curiosity being excited by the monotonous  hum of the students within, I made bold to enter and creep along a crack  between two boards until I reached the far end, where, in front of a hearth  of glowing embers, sat the master at his desk.    "No one noticed so small a creature as a Woggle-Bug, and when I found that  the hearth was even warmer and more comfortable than the sunshine, I  resolved to establish my future home beside it. So I found a charming nest  between two bricks and hid myself therein for many, many months.    "Professor Nowitall is, doubtless, the most famous scholar in the land of  Oz, and after a few days I began to listen to the lectures and discourses he  gave his pupils. Not one of them was more attentive than the humble,  unnoticed Woggle-Bug, and I acquired in this way a fund of knowledge that I  will myself confess is simply marvelous. That is why I place 'T.E.'  Thoroughly Educated upon my cards; for my greatest pride lies in the fact  that the world cannot produce another Woggle-Bug with a tenth part of my own  culture and erudition."
