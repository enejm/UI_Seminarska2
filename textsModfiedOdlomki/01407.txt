In sudden, overpowering horror, he seized the fur coats and returned to  the control room.    *       *       *       *       *    Dr. Mundson was changing the speed.    "Look out the window!" he called to Northwood.    The young man looked and started violently. Day had come, and now that  the sun-ship was flying at a moderate speed, the ocean beneath was  plainly visible; and its entire surface was covered with broken floes of  ice and small, ragged icebergs. He seized a telescope and focused it  below. A typical polar scene met his eyes: penguins strutted about on  cakes of ice, a whale blowing in the icy water.    "A part of the Antarctic that has never been explored," said Dr.  Mundson; "and there, just showing on the horizon, is the Great Ice  Barrier." His characteristic smile lighted the morose black eyes. "I am  enough of the dramatist to wish you to be impressed with what I shall  show you within less than an hour. Accordingly, I shall make a landing  and let you feel polar ice under your feet."    After less than a minute's search, Dr. Mundson found a suitable place on  the ice for a landing, and, with a few deft manipulations of the  controls, brought the sun-ship swooping down like an eagle on its prey.    For a long moment after the scientist had stepped out on the ice,  Northwood paused at the door. His feet were chained by a strange  reluctance to enter this white, dead wilderness of ice. But Dr.  Mundson's impatient, "Ready?" drew from him one last glance at the cozy  interior of the sun-ship before he, too, went out into the frozen  stillness.    They left the sun-ship resting on the ice like a fallen silver moon,  while they wandered to the edge of the Barrier and looked at the gray,  narrow stretch of sea between the ice pack and the high cliffs of the  Barrier. The sun of the commencing six-months' Antarctic day was a low,
