vengeance. Vengeance! An eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth--the old  law peculiar to man! Chanley Beddoes had slain one of them; if only  the _Peary's_ crew had not killed more! If only that, there might be  hope!    First he must get inside the submarine. Warily, like a stalking cat,  Ken Torrance inched the torpoon toward the great shining ship. At  least he was in time. Within her he could see figures, most of them  stretched out on the decks of her different compartments, but one of  whom occasionally moved--slowly. He understood that. For weeks now the  _Peary_ had lain captive, and her air had passed beyond the aid of  rectifiers. Tortured, those survivors inside were, constantly  struggling for life, with vitality ever sinking lower. Some might  already be dead. But at least he could try to save the rest.    He approached her from one side of the rear, for in the rear  compartment were her two torpoon port-locks. The one on his side was  empty, its outer door open. The torpoon it had held had been sent out,  probably for help, and had not returned. It provided a means of  entrance for him.    At perhaps a hundred feet from the port-lock, Ken halted again. His  slim craft was almost indistinguishable in the murk: he felt  reasonably safe from discovery. For minutes he watched the swimming  sealmen, waiting for the best chance to dart in.    *       *       *       *       *    It was then, while studying the full length of the submarine more  closely, that he saw that one compartment of her four was filled with  water. Her steel-caped bow had been stove in. That, he conjectured,  had been the original accident which had brought her down. It was not  a fatal accident in itself, for there were three other compartments,  all separated by watertight bulkheads, and the flooded one could be  repaired by men in sea-suits--but then the sealmen had come and roped  her down where she lay. Some of the creatures, he saw, were actually
