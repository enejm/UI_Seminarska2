   I saw that his revolver was in his hand.    Nearer and nearer came the hoofs. The moon shone out now clear and full,  so that the road was white with it. The ground was hard, and we had left  no traces.    “Here they come!” whispered Sapt.    “It’s the duke!”    “I thought so,” he answered.    It was the duke; and with him a burly fellow whom I knew well, and who  had cause to know me afterwards--Max Holf, brother to Johann the keeper,  and body-servant to his Highness. They were up to us: the duke reined  up. I saw Sapt’s finger curl lovingly towards the trigger. I believe  he would have given ten years of his life for a shot; and he could have  picked off Black Michael as easily as I could a barn-door fowl in a  farmyard. I laid my hand on his arm. He nodded reassuringly: he was  always ready to sacrifice inclination to duty.    “Which way?” asked Black Michael.    “To the Castle, your Highness,” urged his companion. “There we shall  learn the truth.”    For an instant the duke hesitated.    “I thought I heard hoofs,” said he.    “I think not, your Highness.”    “Why shouldn’t we go to the lodge?”    “I fear a trap. If all is well, why go to the lodge? If not, it’s a  snare to trap us.”    Suddenly the duke’s horse neighed. In an instant we folded our cloaks  close round our horses’ heads, and, holding them thus, covered the duke  and his attendant with our revolvers. If they had found us, they had  been dead men, or our prisoners.    Michael waited a moment longer. Then he cried:    “To Zenda, then!” and setting spurs to his horse, galloped on.    Sapt raised his weapon after him, and there was such an expression  of wistful regret on his face that I had much ado not to burst out  laughing.    For ten minutes we stayed where we were.    “You see,” said Sapt, “they’ve sent him news that all is well.”
