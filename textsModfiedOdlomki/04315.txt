minutes--maximum possible--and get out before it blows--out of the  water I mean. The fish-boat is not constructed to take explosions even  half a mile away. But the first thing is to find the fuse and I cannot  make out how _Gilgamesh_ is lying and therefore cannot find the door  through this bulkhead; everything is ripped and twisted. In the end I  find a gap between the bulkhead itself and the hull, and squeeze  through that.    In the next compartment things are more recognizable and I eventually  find the door. Fortunately ships are designed so that you can get  through doors even when they are in the ceiling; actually here I have  to climb up an overhang, but the surface is provided with rungs which  make it not too bad. Finally I reach the door. I shall have to use  antigrav to get down ... why didn't I just turn it on and jump? I  forgot I had it.    The door was a little way open when the missile struck; it buckled in  its grooves and is jammed fast. I can get an arm through. No more. I  switch on antigrav and hang there directing the light round the  compartment. No rents anywhere, just buckling. This compartment is  divided by a partition and the door through that is open. There will  be another door into the nose on the other side.    I bring back my feet ready to kick off on a dive through that doorway.    Behind me, something stirs.    *       *       *       *       *    My muscles go into a spasm like the one that causes a falling dream,  my hold tears loose and I go tumbling through the air, rebound from a  wall, twist, and manage to hook one foot in the frame of the door I  was aiming for. I pull myself down and turn off the antigrav; then I  just shake for a bit.    The sound was--    This is stupid, with everything torn to pieces in this ship there is
