  "Because it's getting hotter." The kid gave it to me straight. "All the  ice at the North Pole is gonna melt. The ocean is gonna rise two hundred  feet. Then everybody who doesn't live on a hill is gonna be drownded.  That's what Elmer says and Elmer isn't ever wrong."    [Illustration: Illustrated by CAVAT]    Doreen they called her! Why not Cassandra? The stuff kids spout these  days!    I gave her a foolish grin. I wanted Marge to get the idea I was really a  family man at heart. "That's very interesting, Doreen. Now look, there's  the baseball game. Let's watch, shall we?"    We weren't very late after all. It was the top half of the second  inning, the score one to one, Erskine in trouble with two men on and  only one down. The colors were beautiful. Marge and I were just settling  back to watch when Doreen wrinkled her nose.    "I saw that game yesterday!" she announced.    "You couldn't have, sweetheart," I told her. "Because it's only being  played today. The world's first ball game ever broadcast in color."    "There was a game on Elmer's TV," Doreen insisted. "The picture was  bigger and the colors prettier, too."    "Absolutely impossible." I was a little sore. I hate kids who tell fibs.  "There never was a game broadcast in color before. And, anyway, you  won't find a color tube this big any place outside of a laboratory."    "But it's true, Bill." Marge looked at me, wide-eyed. "Elmer only has a  little seven-inch black and white set his uncle gave him. But he's  rigged up some kind of lens in front of it, and it projects a big color  picture on a white screen."    I saw that she was serious. My eyes bugged slightly. "Listen," I said,  "who is this Elmer character? I want to meet him!"    "He's my cousin from South America," Doreen answered. "He thinks  grownups are stupid." She turned to Marge. "I have to go to the  bathroom," she said primly.    "Through that door." Marge pointed.    Doreen trotted out, clutching her hat box.
