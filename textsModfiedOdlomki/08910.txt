and, looking at the country beyond, I gave an exclamation of dismay. To  say that it was desert would be saying too much; it was more like the  Karroo in the Cape--a vast sandy waste, studded here and there with low  shrubs and scattered rocks. But it was a great expanse of desolate land,  stretching further than the eye could reach, and bordered far away by  a line of purple hills, in the centre of which a great solitary peak  soared high into the air.    “Indaba-zimbi,” I said, “we can never cross this if we take six days.”    “As you will, Macumazahn,” he answered; “but I tell you that there”--and  he pointed to the peak--“there the white man lives.

Not a spring, not a pool, not a head of game! It was the third  night; we were nearly mad with thirst. Tota was in a comatose condition.  Indaba-zimbi still had a little water in his bottle--perhaps a
