This next day Jetta dutifully had kept herself secluded. She cooked  her own breakfast while I was at the Government House, and was again  out of sight by noon.    Jetta was nearly always alone. I can picture her sitting there within  the narrow walls of her little room. Boy's ragged garb. All possible  femininity stripped from her. Yet, within her, the woman's instincts  were struggling. She sewed a great deal, she since has told me, there  in the cloistered dimness. Making little dresses of silk and bits of  finery given her surreptitiously by the neighbor women. Gazing at  herself in them with the aid of a tiny mirror. Hiding them away, never  daring to wear them openly; until at intervals her father would raid  the room, find them and burn them in the kitchen incinerator.    "Instincts of Satan! By damn but I will get these woman's instincts  out of you, Jetta!"    *       *       *       *       *    And there were hours when she would try to read hidden books, and look  at pictures of the strange fairy world of the Highlands. She could  read and write a little: she had gone for a few years to the small  Nareda government school, and then been snatched from it by her  father.    When Spawn and I had finished that noonday meal, I recall that he left  me for a moment. He had gone to Jetta.    "I am taking that young American to the mine. I will return presently.  Stay close, Jetta."    "Yes, Father."    He left with me. Jetta remained in her room, her thoughts upon the  coming night. She trembled at them. She would meet me again, this  evening in the moonlit garden....    The sound of a man walking the garden path aroused her from her  reverie. Then came a soft ingratiating voice:    "Jetta, _chica Mia_!"    It was Perona, standing by the pergola preening his effeminate  mustache.
