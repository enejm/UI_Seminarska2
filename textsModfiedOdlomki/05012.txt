 Q. Does a stone have a purpose when it falls?    A. I'm not talking about values. What are the alternatives you  imply in the decision?    Q. There are three. We destroy them; we absorb them; we ignore  them.    A. I'm afraid they can't be ignored.    Q. Why not?    A. It's too late. The Unity should have started ignoring them right  at the beginning--we are already changed. And if they are absorbed,  we shall be still more changed.    Q. _They_ will be changed. The Unity is eternal and--    A. You ought to talk to a man called Heisenberg. He called it the  inexactitude principle, but it's the same thing. For example, men  are always going around asking each other questions; they call it  taking a poll, only when you try to find out that way what people  are thinking, you change them. Or anthropology--when you study a  tribe, you alter its way of life. Furthermore, it alters yours.    Q. It would appear that you have lost your sense of objectivity.    A. That's the way my last husband talks. There is no such thing.  It's a strange fact, but it seems that the mathematicians are the  only ones who have a glimmering of the truth--they and the  physicists. I was beginning to think that mankind as a whole was  progressing quite nicely.    Q. I thought you said they were. It seems you're never satisfied.    A. Well, some things improve, but their point of view keeps  changing with regard to what should and what should not improve.
