whatsoever.    The Brain would never communicate with me with witnesses present or  recording wires. It would detect those immediately and I would only  stand convicted as a liar or worse. Tonight's events might well spell  the end, the closing of the door just when I thought I stood on the  threshold of a momentous discovery....    *       *       *       *       *    Cephalon Ariz. Nov. 11th.    Went to the P. G. last night. Tried everything for over an hour. Result:  zero. No contact with The Brain.    *       *       *       *       *    Cephalon Ariz. Nov. 13th.    I tried it again. Took greatest care in exactly duplicating conditions.  Nothing. I don't think it's any mechanical defect. It's the negativism  of a will. Ludicrous as it sounds, The Brain sulks, it is angry with me.    *       *       *       *       *    Cephalon Ariz. Nov. 15th.    Last night the same old story. The Brain punishes me. I dare say that it  succeeds in that exceedingly well; it almost drives me crazy.    I've done a lot of thinking over these past six days of frustration.  I've also been reading a good deal in context with the phenomena  psychology, Osterkamp's history of brain-surgery, Van Gehuchten's work  on brain mechanisms, etc. I've reached certain conclusions and, just for  the hell of it, I'll jot them down.    What I need is proof, _scientific_ proof that The Brain is a personality  possessed with the gift of thought and actually using it for  _independent_ thought, extracurricular to the problems which are being  submitted to it from the outside.
