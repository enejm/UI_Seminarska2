  "It would seem so," said Hawk Carse.    He amplified his evidence. "Look at these space-suits we're wearing.  We got them and escaped by them, but they're Dr. Ku's. Couldn't he  have protected himself with one too? He had plenty of time. And then  the construction of the asteroid's buildings--all metal, with tight,  sealed doors! Oh, stupid, stupid! Why didn't I see it all before?  Here, in my weakness and sickness, I thought we'd killed Ku Sui and  destroyed the coordinated brains!"    Leithgow looked suddenly very old and tired. The calamity did not end  there. There were other angles, and an immediate one of high danger.  In a lifeless voice he said:    "Carse, our whole situation's changed by this. We intended to go  straight to my laboratory, but we may not be able to. The laboratory  may already be closed to us. And even if not, there'd be a big risk in  going there."    "Closed to us by what?" the Hawk demanded sharply. "At risk from  what?"    Old Leithgow pressed his hands over his face. "Let me think a moment,"  he said.    *       *       *       *       *    There were very good reasons why Eliot Leithgow maintained his chief  laboratory on the dangerous Satellite III. Other planets might have  offered more friendly locations, but III possessed stores of  accessible minerals valuable to the scientist's varied work, and its  position in the solar system was most convenient, being roughly  halfway between Earth and the outermost frontiers. Leithgow had  counterbalanced the inherent peril of the laboratory's location by  ingenious camouflage, intricate defenses and hidden underground  entrances; had, indeed, hidden it so well that none of the scavengers  and brigands and more personal enemies who infested Port o' Porno  remotely suspected that his headquarters was on the satellite at all.  Ships, men, could pass over it a score of times with never an inkling  that it lay below.    After a short silence, Eliot Leithgow began his explanation.
