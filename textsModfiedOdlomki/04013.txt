"The truth, O dweller in blue shadows of primordial  ice, is," said the most intelligent of the Thither folk as we sat over  fried deer-steak in his hut that evening, "we who are MEN, not  Peri-zad, not overstayed fairies like those you have been amongst, are  newcomers here on this shore.  We came but a few generations ago from  where the gold curtains of the sun lie behind the westward pine-trees,  and as we came we drove, year by year, those fays, those spent  triflers, back before us.  All this land was theirs once, and more and  more towards our old home.
