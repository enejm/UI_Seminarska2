The next day and the next they spun around the bay on the ice-boat.  Even Staples, who seemed to be tired of almost everything, liked the  swiftness and exhilaration of the iceboat.    One afternoon, Brown walked into the bar of the hotel, where he found  Staples standing.    "See here, Armstrong." he cried, slapping that gentleman on the  shoulder. "Are you in for a bit of sport? It's a nice moonlight night,  and I'm going to take a spin down to Hamilton to meet some chaps, and  we can come back on the iceboat, or if you think it too late, you can  stay over, and come back on the train."
