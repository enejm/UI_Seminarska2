The air was alive with darting forms. Harkness saw them plainly  now--great trailing streamers of speed that shot downward from the  heights. The sun caught them in their flight to make iridescent  rainbow hues that would have been beautiful but for the hideous heads,  the sucker-discs that lined the bodies and the one great disc that  cupped on the end of each thrusting snout.    And beneath those that fell from on high was a cluster of the same  sinister, writhing shapes which clung to a speeding ship that rolled  and swung vainly in an effort to shake them off.    The coiling, slashing serpent-forms had fastened to the doomed ship.  Their thrashing bodies streamed out behind it.

He  threw the ship like a giant shell in a screaming, sweeping arc upon
