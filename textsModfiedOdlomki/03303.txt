  I told him I had met one.    "Irritating, wasn't it, Conru? Humiliating. Of course, these lads  will be reconditioned to civilization when they finish their military  service and prepare for more specialized work. Yes, treating all  Earthlings alike is the solution. We put restrictions on these  colonials; they can't hold top jobs, and so on. And we encourage wild  stories about brutality on our part. Not enough to make everybody mad  at us, or even a majority--the rumored tyranny has always happened to  someone else. But there's a certain class of beings who'll get fighting  mad, and that's the class we want."    "The leaders," I chimed in. "The idealists. Brave, intelligent,  patriotic. The kind who probably wouldn't be a part of this racial  bickering, anyway."    "Right," said the Coordinator. "We'll give them the ammunition for  their propaganda. We've _been_ doing it. Result: the leaders get mad.  Races, religions, nationalities, they hate us worse than they hate each  other."    *       *       *       *       *    The way he painted it, I was hardly needed at all. I told him that.    "Ideally, that would be the situation, Conru. Only it doesn't work  that way." He took out a soft cloth and wiped his forehead. "Even the  leaders are too involved in this myth of differences and they can't  concentrate all their efforts. Luron, of course, would be the other  alternative--"    That was a very logical statement, but sometimes logic has a way of  making you laugh, and I was laughing now. Luron considered itself our  arch-enemy. With a few dozen allies on a path of conquest, Luron  thought it could wrest Empire from our hands. Well, we let them play.  And each time Luron swooped down on one of the more primitive planets,  we let them, for Luron would serve as well as ourselves in goading  backward peoples to unite and advance. Perhaps Luron, as a social  entity, grew wiser each time. Certainly the primitive colonials did.
