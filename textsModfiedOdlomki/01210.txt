out into a profuse sweat, and tried to moisten my lips with my tongue.  My throat had gone suddenly dry, and I coughed, huskily. It came back to  me, in a dozen, horrible, throaty tones, mockingly. I peered,  helplessly, into the gloom; but still nothing showed. I had a strange,  choky sensation, and again I coughed, dryly. Again the echo took it up,  rising and falling, grotesquely, and dying slowly into a  muffled silence.    Then, suddenly, a thought came to me, and I held my breath. The other  breathing stopped. I breathed again, and, once more, it re-commenced.  But now, I no longer feared. I knew that the strange sounds were not  made by any lurking Swine-creature; but were simply the echo of my own  respirations.    Yet, I had received such a fright, that I was glad to scramble up the  rift, and haul up the rope.

In my belt, I had a heavy horse-pistol, loaded  with buckshot.    As before, I fastened the rope to the tree. Then, having tied my gun
