  When Prince Marvel, with Nerle marching close behind, entered the great  room, Terribus looked at him sharply a moment, and then bowed.  And  when he bowed the eye upon the top of his head also looked sharply at  the intruders.    Then the king spoke, his voice sounding so sweet and agreeable that it  almost shocked Nerle, who had expected to hear a roar like that from a  wild beast.    "Why are you here?" asked Terribus.    "Partly by chance and partly from curiosity," answered Prince Marvel.  "No one in this island, except your own people, had ever seen the king  of Spor; so, finding myself in your country, I decided to come here and  have a look at you."    The faces of the people who stood about the throne wore frightened  looks at the unheard of boldness of this speech to their terrible  monarch.  But the king merely nodded and inquired:    "Since you have seen me, what do you think of me?"    "I am sorry you asked that question," returned the prince; "for I must  confess you are a very frightful-looking creature, and not at all  agreeable to gaze upon."    "Ha! you are honest, as well as frank," exclaimed the king.  "But that  is the reason I do not leave my kingdom, as you will readily  understand.  And that is the reason I never permit strangers to come  here, under penalty of death.  So long as no one knows the King of Spor  is a monster people will not gossip about my looks, and I am very  sensitive regarding my personal appearance.  You will perhaps  understand that if I could have chosen I should have been born  beautiful instead of ugly."    "I certainly understand that.  And permit me to say I wish you were  beautiful.  I shall probably dream of you for many nights," added the  prince.    "Not for many," said King Terribus, quietly.  "By coming here you have  chosen death, and the dead do not dream."    "Why should I die?" inquired Prince Marvel, curiously.
