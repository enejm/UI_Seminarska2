at a desk near the elevator. As I spied him a green light glowed in  front of him twice.    "They've got him, sir, bringing him in."    A low-toned order. The soldiers sprang to their post. A whirring  signal. At the other end of the room the steel wall began to move  upward, and water rushed in. A tremendous vibration shook the chamber:  a ponderous thudding. The water rose to the level of the balcony and  stopped. I looked at Bradley.    "We're beneath the surface, aren't we?" I asked. "How is it that the  water doesn't fill the room?"    "Pumps," he replied. "Tremendous pumps that draw the water out just as  fast as it comes in, and shoot it out again into the sea. We can  maintain any desired level in here."    Then I noticed that the black flood was rushing by beneath me at a  terrific rate.    Something bulked in the opening. Two tiny subs drew in, a black and a  green. The steel wall rushed down again, and the vibration ceased.  From the green craft heavy grapples extended, clutching the black,  enemy scout. I saw a gaping hole in the black boat's nose, where its  eye had been smashed.    Men were clambering over both vessels' hulls, tugging at the hatchway  fastenings. The black one flew open. I leaped to the deck. Bradley  after me, and jumped down into the hold.    In the little cubby-hole that was all the machinery left space for, a  pale-faced form in green-gray crouched against the wall. His eyes  stared in fear. A Russian, praise be. And not far from my size and  build.    "Off with his clothes, quick!" I yelled, stripping mine as I spoke.  Bradley looked at me queerly, and shrugged his shoulders. "Quick, man!  Everything depends on speed!"    He shook his head, as one who listens to the vaporings of an imbecile,  but turned to obey. I was standing there--naked, studying the  Easterner's face, his body. No scars. Good.    *       *       *       *       *
