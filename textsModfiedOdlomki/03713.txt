Muldoon crept closer until he was able to make out details. Not too many  but enough to give him an idea of the size and general shape of the  thing. But what really held him were the figures of Robert and Evin  Reeger.    He saw them quite distinctly.    One of the twins was bent over a machine of some sort. There were  levers, gears, and rollers mounted on a webbed platform no larger than a  rather oversized typewriter. Muldoon's eyes went wide at the sight of  the greenbacks coming in a steady stream from the interior of the  machine and falling into a box at the side. He could see very little  else that was in the room, other than the brother of the twin at the  machine. He was on the far side of it, fiddling with something hidden.    Muldoon stared in fascination for another minute, then carefully made  his way back to the car. He had parked it within the growth of scrub  trees and bushes. He started it, turned the headlights on, and drove  slowly out into the open and up to the shack. He honked his horn loudly  a couple of times and got out of the car and walked up to the shack and  tried the door. It was closed.    Presently the figures of Evin and Robert Reeger came into view from the  direction of the dump heap. Muldoon's figure was outlined in the glow of  the headlights. Muldoon noticed the brief case one of them was carrying.    "Ah, there, Muldoon," Muldoon had recognized Robert's voice.    "Hello, Mr. Reeger. Thought I'd come by and let you know how I've been  doing."    Evin, who was carrying the brief case, unlocked the door and switched on  the light. The other two followed him into the room. Robert Reeger  motioned for Muldoon to take the sofa. Evin went into the other room.    "Well, my boy," Robert said heartily. "How is it going?"    "Slowly," Muldoon said casually. "But the first of this sort of  operation has to go that way. Kind of feel things out, if you know what  I mean?"
