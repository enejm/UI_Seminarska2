 the seven shells left in the nitro-gun's magazine had to count; and  the first of them gave a good example.    Ken turned down in time to see the death of the man first attacked.  His suit was ripped clean across, his air of life went up in bubbles,  and the water came in. The seal-creature lunged at its falling victim  a last time, and as it did so its smooth brown body crossed Ken's  sights. The torpooner fired, and saw his shell strike home, for the  body shuddered, convulsed, and the sealman, internally torn, went  sinking in a dark cloud after the human it had slain.    That sight gave pause to the other two creatures that had arrived, and  gave Ken Torrance a good second chance. Motor throbbing, the torpoon  turned like a thing alive. Its snout and gun-sights swerving straight  toward the next target. But, when just on the point of pressing the  trigger, Ken's torpoon was struck a terrific blow and tumbled over and  over. The whole external scene blurred to him, and only after a moment  was he able to bring the torpoon back to an even keel.    He saw what had happened. While he had been sighting on the second  seal-creature, the third had attacked the torpoon from the rear by  striking it with all the strength of its heavy, muscular body. But it  did not follow up its attack. For it had crashed in to the whirling  propeller, and now it was hanging well back, its head horribly gashed  by the steel blades.    For a moment the three combatants hung still, both sealmen staring at  the torpoon as if in wonder that it could strike both with its bow and  stern, and Ken Torrance rapidly glancing over the situation. The  remaining two of the last group of three men, he saw, had reached the  top, and the foremost of the _Peary's_ crew were within several feet  of the new hole in the ice. In a very short time all would be out and  safe. Until then he had to hold off the two sealmen.    Two? There were no longer only two, but five--ten--a dozen--and more.
