  "Yuara cannot live," was Yuara's cool reply. "Where once the poison has  entered, there follows death."    "Is Yuara then a coward, that he will die without a fight? Then he is no  Mayoruna, for no Mayoruna is a coward. Let Yuara die if he will. His  comrades shall carry to their _maloca_ the tale that, although the white  man would have saved him, he died like an old woman, because he had not  the will to live!"    Fire shot into the eyes of the prostrate man. He ground his teeth and  struggled to rise and throttle the insulting Brazilian.    "No, not that way," Lourenço went on at once. "Yuara can fight the death  demon only by drawing into himself the air in which is the spirit of  life. The wise white man has stopped the poison at the place where the  cloth is tied, and he knows the air spirits will help Yuara if Yuara  will breathe deep and long. If he will not, then the white man's  medicine cannot save him. Yuara's life or death is in his own hands."    In his heart Lourenço had faint hope that the injured man would live.  But he knew the rest of the cannibal tribe must soon hear the tale of  this incident from the three now present, and he was preparing an  excellent excuse for the failure of McKay to save him. Whether Yuara  lived or not, the Mayorunas now would know that the whites had done  their utmost for him, and that very fact might make a vast difference.    Yuara, though his eyes still flamed, sank back under McKay's restraining  weight and obeyed orders. After the first couple of breaths he settled  into his task and his chest rose and fell rhythmically.    "Here's yer salt, Cap. What'll I do with it?"    "You come here and hold this tourniquet. Don't let it slip! Merry, fill  this chap's mouth with salt. Lourenço, tell him to hold it as long as  possible, then swallow it. Now, Merry, fix up a good strong salt  poultice. The rest of you make camp. We've got a stiff fight on our  hands, and we can't go farther until we've either won or lost."
