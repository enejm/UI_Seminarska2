 daughters of men, and found that they were fair?”    “It is so written,” I answered.    “Then, Holly, might it not have chanced that once a daughter of Heaven  came down to a man of Earth and loved him well? Might it not chance that  for her great sin, she, this high, fallen star, who had befouled her  immortal state for him, was doomed to suffer till at length his love,  made divine by pain and faithful even to a memory, was permitted to  redeem her?”    Now at length I saw light and sprang up eagerly, but in a cold voice she  added:    “Nay, Holly, cease to question me, for there are things of which I can  but speak to thee in figures and in parables, not to mock and bewilder  thee, but because I must. Interpret them as thou wilt. Still, Atene  thought me no mortal, since she told us that man and spirit may not  mate; and there are matters in which I let her judgment weigh with me,  as without doubt now, as in other lives, she and that old Shaman, her  uncle, have wisdom, aye, and foresight. So bid my lord press me no more  to wed him, for it gives me pain to say him nay--ah! thou knowest not  how much.    “Moreover, I will declare myself to thee, old friend; whatever else  I be, at least I am too womanly to listen to the pleadings of my best  beloved and not myself be moved. See, I have set a curb upon desire  and drawn it until my heart bleeds; but if he pursues me with continual  words and looks of burning love, who knoweth but that I shall kindle in  his flame and throw the reins of reason to the winds?    “Oh, then together we might race adown our passions’ steep; together  dare the torrent that rages at its foot, and there perchance be whelmed  or torn asunder. Nay, nay, another space of journeying, but a little  space, and we reach the bridge my wisdom found, and cross it safely, and  beyond for ever ride on at ease through the happy meadows of our love.”
