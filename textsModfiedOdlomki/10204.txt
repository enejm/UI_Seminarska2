 the way. Only occasionally did the party pass a tenanted hut. Generally  they saw by the dull glow of the log that smouldered in every habitation  that it was empty. Once a sick woman called to them in passing. It was  near her time, she said, and there was none to help her in the supreme  moment of her agony.    "God help you, sister!" said Sanders, ever in awe of the mysteries of  birth. "I will send women to you. What is your name?"    "They will not come," said the plaintive voice. "To-night the men go out  to war, and the women wait for the great dance."    "To-night?"    "To-night, master--so the ghosts of brass decree."    Sanders made a clicking noise with his mouth.    "That we shall see," he said, and went on.    The party reached the outskirts of the city. Before them, outlined  against a bronze sky, was the dark bulk of a little hill, and this they  skirted.    The bronze became red, and rose, and dull bronze again, as the fires  that gave it colour leapt or fell. Turning the shoulder of the hill,  Sanders had a full view of the scene.    Between the edge of the forest and slope of the hill was a broad strip  of level land. On the left was the river, on the right was swamp and  forest again.    In the very centre of the plain a huge fire burnt. Before it, supported  by its poles, on two high trestles, a square box.    But the people!    A huge circle, squatting on its haunches, motionless, silent; men,  women, children, tiny babies, at their mothers' hips they stretched; a  solid wheel of humanity, with the box and the fire as a hub.    There was a lane through which a man might reach the box--a lane along  which passed a procession of naked men, going and returning. These were  they who replenished the fire, and Sanders saw them dragging fuel for  that purpose. Keeping to the edge of the crowd, he worked his way to the  opening. Then he looked round at his men.
