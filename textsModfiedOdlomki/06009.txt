  "That's my father," Beth said after he and I had shaken hands and he had  left. "Demands exactness. He's a scientist, you know. A physicist."    "Oh?" I said. As if I hadn't known. "Is he always this busy?"    "Busier. If he isn't working at the lab till all hours, he's working at  home in his study. Or having conferences. The only time I have him alone  and to myself is Sunday evening."    That was the information I had been hoping for.    *       *       *       *       *    Beth and I sat on the couch her father had vacated. We talked. I watched  my words carefully; there were a good many commonplace things I knew  nothing about. And I didn't want any more questions about myself.  Fortunately, conversation between a young man and a young woman is much  the same everywhere. I didn't have to pretend I was interested in Beth.  She was unusually attractive. And she seemed to find me so.    We talked a bit, laughed a good deal, and when I got up to leave I knew  that I had done well in the initial stage. But there was still a good  deal to be done.    "May I see you tonight?" I asked. "Just a 'coke date'."    That was an expression I'd heard and had taken the trouble to make  certain I understood. It seemed to be just the thing in the present  case.    "I'd like that," Beth said. "Pick me up about nine."    Her choice of time could not have been more suitable. I was out of  money. There was Mrs. Mara to be paid, and now the cost of the evening's  entertainment.    Until darkness fell I could do nothing about that. So I went back to my  room and read old newspapers I had collected. I had discovered on my  first day that those were the best sources of information. Those and the  moving pictures.
