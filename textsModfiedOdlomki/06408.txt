must know he has no chance in the long run.'    'I said he was an educated man, but he is also a Kaffir.  He can see  the first stage of a thing, and maybe the second, but no more.  That is  the native mind.  If it was not like that our chance would be the  worse.'    'You say the scheme is ripe,' I said; 'how ripe?'    Arcoll looked at the clock.

Then they move south, picking up  contingents; and the final concentration is to be on the high veld near  Amsterdam, which is convenient for the Swazis and the Zulus.  After  that I know nothing, but of course there are local concentrations along  the whole line of the Berg from Mashonaland to Basutoland.  Now, look
