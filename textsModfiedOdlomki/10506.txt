 "For the three thousand pounds," repeated Bones soberly.  He put in his  monocle and glared at her.  "For the three thousand pounds," he  repeated.    She stood waiting, and Bones stood waiting, he in some embarrassment as  to the method by which the interview might be terminated and his  secretary dismissed without any wound to her feelings.    "Don't you think to-morrow would do for the cheque?" she asked.    "Certainly, certainly," said Bones.  "Why not?  To-morrow's Friday,  ain't it?"    She inclined her head and walked out of the room, and Bones cleared his  throat once more.    "Bones----"    The young man turned to meet Hamilton's accusing eye.    "Bones," said Hamilton gently, "who is the lady?"    "Who is the lady?" repeated Bones, with a cough.  "The lady is my  secretary, dear old inquisitor."    "So I gather," said Hamilton.    "She is my secretary," repeated Bones.  "An extremely sensible young  woman, extremely sensible."    "Don't be silly," said Hamilton.  "Plenty of people are sensible.  When  you talk about sensible young women, you mean plain young women."    "That's true," said Bones; "I never thought of that.  What a naughty  old mind you have, Ham."    He seemed inclined to change the subject.    "And now, dear old son," said Bones, with a brisk return to his  what-can-I-do-for-you air, "to business!  You've come, dear old thing,  to consult me."    "You're surprisingly right," said Hamilton.    "Well," said Bones, trying three drawers of his desk before he could  find one that opened, "have a cigar, and let us talk."    Hamilton took the proffered weed and eyed it suspiciously.    "Is this one that was given to you, or one that you bought?" he  demanded.    "That, my jolly old officer," said Bones, "is part of a job lot that I  bought pretty cheap.  I've got a rare nose for a bargain----"    "Have you a rare nose for a cigar, that's the point?" asked Hamilton,  as he cut off the end and lit it gingerly.
