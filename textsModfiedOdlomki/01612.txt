 close beneath us. Clouds were overhead, white masses with blue sky  behind them. A day of brilliant sunlight. But soon, with our forward  cruising, it was night. The sunlight dropped beneath the sharply convex  horizon; the sea and the land went purple.    A night of brilliant stars; the Earth was a blazing blue-red point of  light. The heavens visibly were revolving; in an hour or so it would be  daylight again.    On the forward deck now Coniston had appeared, commanding half a dozen  of the crew. They were carrying up caskets of food and the equipment  which was to be given the marooned passengers. And making ready the  disembarking incline, loosening the seals of the side-dome windows.    Sternward on the deck, by the lounge oval, I could see Miko standing.
