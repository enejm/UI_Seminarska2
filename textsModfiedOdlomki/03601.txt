A SECTION  J. KIELGAARD  DIRECTOR    A pretty receptionist goggled at him and said to go in. Dan opened the  inner door.    Kielgaard--big, stocky, expensively dressed--looked up and studied Dan  as he came in. Apparently satisfied, he offered a chair, then took out  a small plastic cartridge and held it in one hand.    "Dan," he said, "what do you know about subspace and null-points?"    "Practically nothing," admitted Dan honestly.    *       *       *       *       *    Kielgaard laughed. "Then I'll fill you in with the layman's analogy,  which is all _I_ know. Suppose you have a newspaper with an ant on the  middle of the front page. To get to the middle of page two, the ant  has to walk to the edge of the paper, then walk back on the inside.  Now suppose the ant could go _through_ the page. The middle of page  two is just a short distance away from the middle of page one. That  going _through_, instead of around, is like travel in subspace. And  a null-point is a place just a short distance away, going through  subspace. The middle of page two, for instance, is a null-point for the  middle of page one."    "Yes," said Dan patiently, waiting for the point of the interview.    Kielgaard pushed the plastic cartridge he'd been holding through a slot  in his desk. A globe to one side lighted up a cottony white, with faint  streaks of blue. "This," he said, "is Porcys."    Dan studied the globe. "Under that cloud blanket, it looks as if it  might be a water world."    "It is. Except for a small continent, the planet is covered with water.  And the water is full of seafood--_edible_ seafood."    Dan frowned, still waiting.    "Galactic Enterprises," said Kielgaard, "has discovered a region in  subspace which has Porcys for one null-point and Earth for another."
