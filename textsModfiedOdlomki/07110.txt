Kovudoo scratched his head.  He was much disappointed.  No Sheik meant  no ransom for the white girl.  Now she was worthless, unless he  utilized her for a feast or--a mate.  The latter thought aroused him.  He spat at a small beetle crawling through the dust before him.  He  eyed Malbihn appraisingly.  These white men were peculiar.  They  traveled far from their own villages without women.  Yet he knew they  cared for women.  But how much did they care for them?--that was the  question that disturbed Kovudoo.    "I know where there is a white girl," he said, unexpectedly.  "If you  wish to buy her she may be had cheap."    Malbihn shrugged.  "We have troubles enough, Kovudoo," he said,  "without burdening ourselves with an old she-hyena, and as for paying  for one--"  Malbihn snapped his fingers in derision.    "She is young," said Kovudoo, "and good looking."    The Swedes laughed.  "There are no good looking white women in the  jungle, Kovudoo," said Jenssen.  "You should be ashamed to try to make  fun of old friends."    Kovudoo sprang to his feet.  "Come," he said, "I will show you that she  is all I say."    Malbihn and Jenssen rose to follow him and as they did so their eyes  met, and Malbihn slowly drooped one of his lids in a sly wink.  Together they followed Kovudoo toward his hut.  In the dim interior  they discerned the figure of a woman lying bound upon a sleeping mat.    Malbihn took a single glance and turned away.  "She must be a thousand  years old, Kovudoo," he said, as he left the hut.    "She is young," cried the savage.  "It is dark in here.  You cannot  see.  Wait, I will have her brought out into the sunlight," and he  commanded the two warriors who watched the girl to cut the bonds from  her ankles and lead her forth for inspection.    Malbihn and Jenssen evinced no eagerness, though both were fairly  bursting with it--not to see the girl but to obtain possession of her.
