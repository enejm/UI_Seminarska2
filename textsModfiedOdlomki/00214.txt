  "I should think she would be," agreed Dorothy. Then, after a moment's  thought, she asked: "Are we friends or enemies? I mean, will you be good  to us, or do you intend to eat us?"    "As for that, we dragonettes would love to eat you, my child; but  unfortunately mother has tied all our tails around the rocks at the back  of our individual caves, so that we can not crawl out to get you.
