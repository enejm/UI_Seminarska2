   "Don't you believe it. The symptoms are showing all over him. Now he's  backing Broadway plays, sponsoring beginning actresses, joining  playwrights' groups--he's the only member of Buskin and Brush who's  never written a play, acted in one, or so much as pulled the rope to  raise the curtain."

It depressed me to see it happen,  for next on Joan's agenda for Braun was an entry into politics as a  fighting liberal--a New Dealer twenty years too late. Since I'm mildly  liberal myself when I'm off duty, I hated to think what Braun's career  might tell me about my own motives, if I'd let it.    *       *       *       *       *    All of which had nothing to do with why I was prowling around the  _Ludmilla_--or did it? I kept remembering Anderton's challenge: "You  can't take such a gamble. There are eight and a half million lives
