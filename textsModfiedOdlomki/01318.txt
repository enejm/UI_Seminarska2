"Supply tanks, machine-shop tanks, ground forces of the air service,  concentrate here!" His finger rested on a spot in the middle of the dead  area. "Reserve tanks take position behind them. Draw off every tank  we've got--take 'em out of action!--and mass them in front, on a line  with our former first line of outposts. Every airplane and helicopter  take the air and engage in general combat with the enemy, wherever the  enemy may be found and in whatever force. And our tanks move straight  through here!"    Orders were snapping into telephone transmitters. The commands had been  relayed before their import was fully realized. Then there was a gasp.    "General!" cried the chief of staff. "If the enemy is massed there,  he'll destroy our forces in detail as they take position!"    "He isn't massed there," said the general, his eyes blazing.

When he is sure of it--his helicopters will sweep across any  minute, now, to see--he'll throw his whole force on our front line.  It'll crumple up. His whole fighting force will smash through to take  us, facing the dead space, in the rear! With twice our numbers, he'll
