For a second, shaken by the terrible barrage, they fell back, leaving  several sprawled bodies on the floor; but they came right back again.    Leithgow got safely to the top of the pile and was snatched out to  temporary safety. Frantically Friday called down to his master; he  seemed on the point of jumping down into the fight himself. But Hawk  Carse had been party to a promise.    He was behind the structure of furniture under the hole he had made in  the ceiling. With one gun he spat death at the coolies, while the other  he emptied at the case of brains. Two stabbing streams of orange angled  from him, one telling with awful effect on the men only two score feet  away, and the other absolutely useless. All over the still-glowing case  it spat its hits, but the glasslike substance resisted it completely,  and remained unscathed.    Carse swore harshly.

Its rays poured in a ruddy flood over the settlement, clearly  illuminating each detail; and comparatively close against the face of  the mighty planet they could see the whitish globe of Satellite III. It  offered the nearest haven. They might arrive famished, but in the  power-equipped space-suits which Friday was lugging they should be able
