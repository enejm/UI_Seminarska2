  Each flash of lurid light from the volcano disclosed further masses of  Drilgoes, armed with their stone spears, apparently assembling for the  attack. Whether Tode had summoned them before the Atlanteans offered  him the rulership of the city, or whether Jim's own plan had been  communicated to them by some telepathic process, it was impossible to  guess, but there was not the least doubt but that they were prepared  to follow him.    Cain nudged Jim and began strapping the other pair of wings about his  body. Jim saw that the energy was supplied by two tiny, lights burning  in the base, cold fire, stored energy whose strength he did not guess.  For, when Cain took him by the hand, and motioned to him to slide the  knob in the groove, he was hurled skyward like a rocket.    There followed a delirious hour.

Rumblings shook the  earth; it was evident that another upheaval was in course of  preparation. The long column of the Drilgoes could be seen, extending
