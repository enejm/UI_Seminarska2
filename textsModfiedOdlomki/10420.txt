M'fusi business, and I can't think why the Government sent him. They are  a pretty bad lot--their territory is at the back of the Akasava, and the  Chief of the M'fusi is a rascal."    "But he says that he has been sent to reform them," said the girl.    Sanders smiled.    "It is not a job I should care to undertake--and yet----"    He knitted his forehead.    "And yet----?"    "I could reform them--Bones could reform them. But if they were reformed  it would break Bonaventura, for he holds his job subject to their  infamy."    At lunch Sanders was unusually silent, a silence which was unnoticed,  save by the girl. Bones and his friend, however, needed no stimulation.  Lunch was an almost deafening meal, and when the time came for the duc  to leave, the whole party went down to the beach to see him embark.    "Good-bye, old Mug!" roared Bones, as the boat pulled away. "Whoop! hi!  how!"    "You're a noisy devil," said Hamilton, admiringly.    "Vox populi, vox Dei," said Bones.    He had an unexpected visitor that evening, for whilst he was dressing  for dinner, Sanders came into his hut--an unusual happening.    What Sanders had to say may not be related since it was quite  unofficial, but Bones came to dinner that night and behaved with such  decorum and preserved a mien so grave, that Hamilton thought he was ill.    The duc continued his journey down the African Coast and presently came  to a port which was little more than a beach, a jetty, a big white  house, and by far the most imposing end of the Moanda road. In due time,  he arrived by the worst track in the world (he was six days on the  journey) at Moanda itself, and came into the presence of the Governor.    Did the duc but know it, his Excellency had also been prepared for the  young man's mission. The mail had arrived by carrier the day before the  duc put in his appearance, and Pinto Bonaventura had his little piece  all ready to say.
