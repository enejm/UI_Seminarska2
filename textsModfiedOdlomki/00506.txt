"Now, my wife, Rora Flathead, having four cans of brains, had become a  wonderful witch, and fish being brain food, she loved to eat fish  better than any one of us. So she vowed she would destroy every fish in  the lake, unless the Skeezers let us catch what we wanted. They defied  us, so Rora prepared a kettleful of magic poison and went down to the  lake one night to dump it all in the water and poison the fish. It was  a clever idea, quite worthy of my dear wife, but the Skeezer Queen--a  young lady named Coo-ee-oh--hid on the bank of the lake and taking Rora  unawares, transformed her into a Golden Pig. The poison was spilled on  the ground and wicked Queen Coo-ee-oh, not content with her cruel  transformation, even took away my wife's four cans of brains, so she is  now a common grunting pig without even brains enough to know her own  name."    "Then," said Ozma thoughtfully, "the Queen of the Skeezers must be a  Sorceress."    "Yes," said the Su-dic, "but she doesn't know much magic, after all.  She is not as powerful as Rora Flathead was, nor half as powerful as I  am now, as Queen Coo-ee-oh will discover when we fight our great battle  and destroy her."    "The Golden Pig can't be a witch any more, of course," observed Dorothy.    "No; even had Queen Coo-ee-oh left her the four cans of brains, poor  Rora, in a pig's shape, couldn't do any witchcraft. A witch has to use  her fingers, and a pig has only cloven hoofs."    "It seems a sad story," was Ozma's comment, "and all the trouble arose  because the Flatheads wanted fish that did not belong to them."    "As for that," said the Su-dic, again angry, "I made a law that any of  my people could catch fish in the Lake of the Skeezers, whenever they  wanted to. So the trouble was through the Skeezers defying my law."    "You can only make laws to govern your own people," asserted Ozma  sternly. "I, alone, am empowered to make laws that must be obeyed by  all the peoples of Oz."
