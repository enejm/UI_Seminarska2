down the sunny vale of Annan.  I talked of Galloway markets and sheep  prices, and he made up his mind I was a 'pack-shepherd' from those  parts--whatever that may be.  My plaid and my old hat, as I have said,  gave me a fine theatrical Scots look.  But driving cattle is a mortally  slow job, and we took the better part of the day to cover a dozen miles.    If I had not had such an anxious heart I would have enjoyed that time.  It was shining blue weather, with a constantly changing prospect of  brown hills and far green meadows, and a continual sound of larks and  curlews and falling streams.  But I had no mind for the summer, and  little for Hislop's conversation, for as the fateful fifteenth of June  drew near I was overweighed with the hopeless difficulties of my  enterprise.
