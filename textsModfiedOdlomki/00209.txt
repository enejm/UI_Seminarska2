before. "You are welcome to what we have."    As he spoke the voice came so near to Zeb that he jumped back in alarm.  Two childish voices laughed merrily at this action, and Dorothy was sure  they were in no danger among such light-hearted folks, even if those  folks couldn't be seen.    "What curious animal is that which is eating the grass on my lawn?"  enquired the man's voice.    "That's Jim," said the girl. "He's a horse."    "What is he good for?" was the next question.    "He draws the buggy you see fastened to him, and we ride in the buggy  instead of walking," she explained.    "Can he fight?" asked the man's voice.    "No! he can kick pretty hard with his heels, and bite a little; but Jim  can't 'zactly fight," she replied.    "Then the bears will get him," said one of the children's voices.    "Bears!" exclaimed Dorothy. "Are these bears here?"    "That is the one evil of our country," answered the invisible man. "Many  large and fierce bears roam in the Valley of Voe, and when they can  catch any of us they eat us up; but as they cannot see us, we seldom get  caught."    "Are the bears invis'ble, too?" asked the girl.    "Yes; for they eat of the dama-fruit, as we all do, and that keeps them  from being seen by any eye, whether human or animal."    "Does the dama-fruit grow on a low bush, and look something like a  peach?" asked the Wizard.    "Yes," was the reply.    "If it makes you invis'ble, why do you eat it?" Dorothy enquired.    "For two reasons, my dear," the woman's voice answered. "The dama-fruit  is the most delicious thing that grows, and when it makes us invisible  the bears cannot find us to eat us up. But now, good wanderers, your  luncheon is on the table, so please sit down and eat as much as you  like."    [Illustration]          CHAPTER 9.    THEY FIGHT THE INVISIBLE BEARS
