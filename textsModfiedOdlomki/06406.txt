else they had gone after some distant business.  Except a batch of  three Shangaans returning from the Rand, I had nobody in the store for  the whole of one day.  So about four o'clock I shut it up, whistled on  Colin, and went for a walk along the Berg.    If there were no natives on the road, there were plenty in the bush.  I  had the impression, of which Wardlaw had spoken, that the native  population of the countryside had suddenly been hugely increased.  The  woods were simply _hotching_ with them.  I was being spied on as before,  but now there were so many at the business that they could not all  conceal their tracks.  Every now and then I had a glimpse of a black  shoulder or leg, and Colin, whom I kept on the leash, was half-mad with  excitement.  I had seen all I wanted, and went home with a preoccupied  mind.  I sat long on Wardlaw's garden-seat, trying to puzzle out the  truth of this spying.    What perplexed me was that I had been left unmolested when I had gone  to Umvelos'.  Now, as I conjectured, the secret of the neighbourhood,  whatever it was, was probably connected with the Rooirand.  But when I  had ridden in that direction and had spent two days in exploring, no  one had troubled to watch me.  I was quite certain about this, for my  eye had grown quick to note espionage, and it is harder for a spy to  hide in the spare bush of the flats than in the dense thickets on these  uplands.    The watchers, then, did not mind my fossicking round their sacred  place.  Why, then, was I so closely watched in the harmless  neighbourhood of the store?  I thought for a long time before an answer  occurred to me.  The reason must be that going to the plains I was  going into native country and away from civilization.  But  Blaauwildebeestefontein was near the frontier.  There must be some dark  business brewing of which they may have feared that I had an inkling.  They wanted to see if I proposed to go to Pietersdorp or Wesselsburg
