and Dorothy's suggestion seems like an inspiration."    The three Adepts also approved the trial but the brown-haired one said:    "We must be careful not to use the wrong word, and send the bridge out  under water. The main thing, if Dorothy's idea is correct, is to hit  upon the one word that moves the island."    "Let us experiment," suggested the Wizard.    In the drawer with the moving gray powder was a tiny golden cup, which  they thought was used for measuring.

Aurah lighted it with her taper and Ozma bent over the  basin and murmured the long drawn syllable: "Oh-h-h!"    Instantly the island trembled and with a weird groaning noise it moved
