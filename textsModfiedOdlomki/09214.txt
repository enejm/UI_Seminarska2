 and everything, completely ignoring the head-wife. For a while Nandie  bore it with patience, but at length she took advantage of a pause in  the conversation to say in her firm, low voice:    “This is my hut, daughter of Umbezi, a thing which you remember well  enough when it is a question whether Saduko, our husband, shall visit  you or me. Can you not remember it now when I would speak with the white  chief, Watcher-by-Night, who has been so good as to take the trouble to  come to see me?”    On hearing these words Mameena leapt up in a rage, and I must say I  never saw her look more lovely.    “You insult me, daughter of Panda, as you always try to do, because you  are jealous of me.”    “Your pardon, sister,” replied Nandie. “Why should I, who am Saduko’s  Inkosikazi, and, as you say, daughter of Panda, the King, be jealous  of the widow of the wizard, Masapo, and the daughter of the headman,  Umbezi, whom it has pleased our husband to take into his house to be the  companion of his leisure?”    “Why? Because you know that Saduko loves my little finger more than  he does your whole body, although you are of the King’s blood and have  borne him brats,” she answered, looking at the infant with no kindly  eye.    “It may be so, daughter of Umbezi, for men have their fancies, and  without doubt you are fair. Yet I would ask you one thing--if Saduko  loves you so much, how comes it he trusts you so little that you must  learn any matter of weight by listening at my door, as I found you doing  the other day?”    “Because you teach him not to do so, O Nandie. Because you are ever  telling him not to consult with me, since she who has betrayed one  husband may betray another. Because you make him believe my place is  that of his toy, not that of his companion, and this although I am  cleverer than you and all your House tied into one bundle, as you may  find out some day.”
