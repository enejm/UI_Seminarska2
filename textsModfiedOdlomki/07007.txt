upon her from every side and then, drawing her knife she turned at bay,  metamorphosed by the fires of fear and hate from a startled deer to a  raging tiger-cat. They did not try to kill her, but only to subdue and  capture her; and so it was that more than a single Ho-don warrior felt  the keen edge of her blade in his flesh before they had succeeded in  overpowering her by numbers. And still she fought and scratched and bit  after they had taken the knife from her until it was necessary to tie  her hands and fasten a piece of wood between her teeth by means of  thongs passed behind her head.    At first she refused to walk when they started off in the direction of  the valley but after two of them had seized her by the hair and dragged  her for a number of yards she thought better of her original decision  and came along with them, though still as defiant as her bound wrists  and gagged mouth would permit.    Near the entrance to Kor-ul-lul they came upon another body of their  warriors with which were several Waz-don prisoners from the tribe of  Kor-ul-lul. It was a raiding party come up from a Ho-don city of the  valley after slaves. This Pan-at-lee knew for the occurrence was by no  means unusual. During her lifetime the tribe to which she belonged had  been sufficiently fortunate, or powerful, to withstand successfully the  majority of such raids made upon them, but yet Pan-at-lee had known of  friends and relatives who had been carried into slavery by the Ho-don  and she knew, too, another thing which gave her hope, as doubtless it  did to each of the other captives--that occasionally the prisoners  escaped from the cities of the hairless whites.    After they had joined the other party the entire band set forth into  the valley and presently, from the conversation of her captors,  Pan-at-lee knew that she was headed for A-lur, the City of Light; while  in the cave of his ancestors, Om-at, chief of the Kor-ul-JA, bemoaned  the loss of both his friend and she that was to have been his mate.
