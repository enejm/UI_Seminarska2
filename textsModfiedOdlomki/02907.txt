they covered some actual growth; he might have had real horns for all I  knew. Nothing would have been too strange to expect.    His clothing showed up as a simple, white, one piece garment, like a  shirt and gym shorts. The shorts ended at the knee, and from there down  he was bare except for a covering on his feet which appeared more like  gloves than shoes. Whatever he wore to protect his feet, it allowed free  movement of his toes.    It struck me that this little man's native habitat must have been very  warm. His attire suggested this. For a moment I considered plugging in  my small heater; my room certainly had no tropical or sub-tropical  temperature at that time of the morning--and how was I to know whether  he shivered when he felt chill. Maybe he blew his horns. Anyway, I  figured a living Eighth Wonder would be more valuable than a dead one;  and I didn't think he could be stuffed. But somehow I forgot it in my  interest in examining this unusual personage.    The little man had dropped the cloth now, and was staring in my  direction. Of course, "my direction" was very general to him; but he  seemed to be conscious of me. He certainly impressed _me_ as being  awfully different, but what his reactions were, I didn't know.    But someone else knew.    *       *       *       *       *    In a world deep down in Smallness, in an electron of a dead cell of a  piece of wood, five scientists were grouped before a complicated  instrument with a horn like the early radios. Two sat and three stood,  but their attention upon the apparatus was unanimous. From small  hollowed cups worn on their fingers like rings, came a smoke from  burning incense. These cups they held to their noses frequently, and  their eyes shone as they inhaled. The scientists of infra-smallness were  smoking!    With the exception of a recent prolonged silence, which was causing them
