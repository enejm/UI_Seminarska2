madly in a soupy atmosphere, few Ejectors could be mobilized and only  one of them in time.    When afterwards, the Explorer lifted out of unconsciousness and rose  to his feet, he had the definite feeling that but for himself and  the Merchant, there were no survivors. And perhaps that was an  over-calculation. His Floater had burnt out while still sufficiently  distant from surface to have the fall stun him. The Merchant might have  had less luck, even, than that.    He was surrounded by a world of thick, ropy stalks of grass, and in the  distance were trees that reminded him vaguely of similar structures on  his native Arcturian world except that their lowest branches were high  above what he would consider normal tree-tops.    He called, his voice sounding basso in the thick air and the Merchant  answered. The Explorer made his way toward him, thrusting violently at  the coarse stalks that barred his path.    "Are you hurt?" he asked.    The Merchant grimaced. "I've sprained something. It hurts to walk."    The Explorer probed gently. "I don't think anything is broken. You'll  have to walk despite the pain."    "Can't we rest first?"    "It's important to try to find the ship. If it is spaceworthy or if it  can be repaired, we may live. Otherwise, we won't."    "Just a few minutes. Let me catch my breath."    The Explorer was glad enough for those few minutes. The Merchant's eyes  were already closed. He allowed his to do the same.    He heard the trampling and his eyes snapped open. Never sleep on a  strange planet, he told himself futilely.    The Merchant was awake too and his steady screaming was a rumble of  terror.    The Explorer called, "It's only a native of this planet. It won't harm  you."    But even as he spoke, the giant had swooped down and in a moment they  were in its grasp being lifted closer to its monstrous ugliness.    The Merchant struggled violently and, of course, quite futilely. "Can't  you talk to it?" he yelled.
