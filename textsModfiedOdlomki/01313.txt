On the top landing Burke, the leader, paused to count the doors from  front to rear.    "This is it," he whispered to the bull-necked fellow just behind him.    The other nodded, and crouched back against the opposite wall while his  companions placed themselves in position to cross-fire into the room the  moment the door gave way.    *       *       *       *       *    Quest longed for the power to kick his hypocrite of a master as he still  held back, cowering on the stairs, playing his fake to the limit. Then  the door flew in with a splintering shriek under the charge of the human  battering ram, and across it hurtled the other two detectives in a cloud  of ancient dust.    "Here he is!" someone shouted.    "Phil! Phil!" Keane Clason's voice fairly quavered with sham emotion as  he ran into the room and threw himself at a man tightly bound to an  upholstered chair, which in turn was wedged in among other articles of  stored furniture.    But Philip was too securely gagged to reply, and as Burke slashed the  ropes from across his chest he dropped forward in a state of collapse.  Stretched on a couch, he soon gave signs of response as a brisk massage  began to restore the circulation to his cramped limbs. Suddenly he sat  up and thrust his rescuers aside.    "What time is it?" he demanded with an air of alarm.    "One o'clock," replied Keane before anyone else could answer, patting  his brother affectionately on the shoulder while within him Quest  writhed with indignation. "By Jove! Phil, it's wonderful that we got to  you in time. Really, how--you're not injured?"    "No," grunted Philip, "just lamed up. I'll be as fit as ever by  to-morrow."    "If you feel equal to it," suggested Burke, "I wish you'd tell me  briefly how you arrived here. Do you know the motive behind this affair?  Did you recognize any of the body-snatchers?"
