 anyhow?"    "The cap's off," Monig reported. "We're getting plenty of radiation now.  Just a minute-- Yeah. Dr. Hadamard, it's a bomb, all right. But it  hasn't got a fuse. Now how could they have made a fool mistake like  that?"    "In other words, it's a dud," Joan said.    "That's right, a dud."    Now, at last, Braun wiped his face, which was quite gray.
