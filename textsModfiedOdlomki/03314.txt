  "And, of course, Epsilon Eridani honestly thinks it has a great  civilizing mission, and is much better for the natives than any lesser  independence could ever be. In some cases, you've got to admit they're  right. Have you ever seen a real simon-pure native king in action? Or  read the history of nations like Germany and Russia? And why do we  have to segregate races and minorities even in our own organization to  prevent clashes?"    "We're getting there," said Nat Hawkins. "It's not easy, but we'll make  it."    _Only you're not there yet_, I thought, _and for that reason you must  be stopped_.    "You claim they're sated," said Barbara. "But they've kept on  conquering here and there, to this very day."    "Believe it or not, but with rare exceptions that's been done  reluctantly. Peripheral systems have learned how to build star ships,  become nuisances or outright menaces, and the Empire has had to swallow  them. Modern technology is simply too deadly for anarchy. A full-scale  war can sterilize whole planets. That's another function of empire, so  the Eridanians claim--just to keep civilization going till something  better can be worked out."    "Such as what?"    "Well, several worlds already have _donagangor_ status--self-government  under the Emperor, representatives in the Imperial Council, and no  restrictions on personal advancement of their citizens. Virtual  equality with the Valgolians. And their policy is to grant such status  to any colony they think is ready for it."    Hawkins shook his head. "Won't do, Con. It sounds nice, but old Tom  Jefferson had the right idea. 'If men must wait in slavery until they  are ready for freedom, they will wait long indeed.'"    "Who said we were slaves--" I began.    "You talk like a damned reddie yourself," said Kane. "You seem to think  pretty highly of the Empire."    *       *       *       *       *    I gave him a cold look. "What do you think I'm doing here?" I snapped.
