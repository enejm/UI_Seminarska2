   "'Bout time you come," growled the god of the car, an hour later, when  Weedon Scott appeared at the door.  "That dog of yourn won't let me lay a  finger on your stuff."    White Fang emerged from the car.  He was astonished.  The nightmare city  was gone.  The car had been to him no more than a room in a house, and  when he had entered it the city had been all around him.  In the interval  the city had disappeared.  The roar of it no longer dinned upon his ears.  Before him was smiling country, streaming with sunshine, lazy with  quietude.  But he had little time to marvel at the transformation.  He  accepted it as he accepted all the unaccountable doings and  manifestations of the gods.  It was their way.    There was a carriage waiting.  A man and a woman approached the master.  The woman's arms went out and clutched the master around the neck--a  hostile act!  The next moment Weedon Scott had torn loose from the  embrace and closed with White Fang, who had become a snarling, raging  demon.    "It's all right, mother," Scott was saying as he kept tight hold of White  Fang and placated him.  "He thought you were going to injure me, and he  wouldn't stand for it.  It's all right.  It's all right.  He'll learn  soon enough."    "And in the meantime I may be permitted to love my son when his dog is  not around," she laughed, though she was pale and weak from the fright.    She looked at White Fang, who snarled and bristled and glared  malevolently.    "He'll have to learn, and he shall, without postponement," Scott said.    He spoke softly to White Fang until he had quieted him, then his voice  became firm.    "Down, sir!  Down with you!"    This had been one of the things taught him by the master, and White Fang  obeyed, though he lay down reluctantly and sullenly.    "Now, mother."    Scott opened his arms to her, but kept his eyes on White Fang.
