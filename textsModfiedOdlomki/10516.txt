 which did not attract the tourist in days of peace.    These were the facts about the Lynhaven line, not as they were set  forth by Mr. Pyeburt--who took a much more optimistic view of the  possibilities of the railway than did its detractors--but as they  really were.    "It's a fine line, beautifully laid and ballasted," said Mr. Pyeburt,  shaking his head with melancholy admiration.  "All that it wants behind  it is a mind.  At present it's neglected; the freights and passenger  fares are too high, the rolling-stock wants replacing, but the  locomotive stock is in most excellent condition."    "Does he want to sell it?" asked the interested Bones, and Mr. Pyeburt  pursed his lips.    "It is extremely doubtful," he said carefully, "but I think he might be  approached.  If he does want to sell it, and you can take it off his  hands----"    He raised his own eyebrows with a significant gesture, which expressed  in some subtle way that Bones's future was assured.    Bones said he would think the matter over, and he did--aloud, in the  presence of Hamilton.    "It's a queer proposition," said Hamilton.  "Of course, derelict  railways can be made to pay."    "I should be general manager," said Bones more thoughtfully still.  "My  name would be printed on all the posters, of course.  And isn't there a  free pass over all the railways for railway managers?"    "I believe there is something of the sort," said Hamilton, "but, on the  whole, I think it would be cheaper to pay your fare than to buy a  railway to get that privilege."    "There is one locomotive," mused Bones.  "It is called 'Mary Louisa.'  Pyeburt told me about it just as I was going away.  Of course, one  would get a bit of a name and all that sort of thing."    He scratched his chin and walked thoughtfully into the office of Miss  Marguerite Whitland.    She swung round in her chair and reached for her notebook, but Bones  was not in a dictatorial mood.
