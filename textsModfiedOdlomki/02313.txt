England, to Newcastle, 270 miles farther north. The human pilot did  not touch the controls until it was necessary to land the plane at the  destination.          Jetta of the Lowlands    Conclusion    _By Ray Cummings_    [Sidenote: Black-garbed figures move in ghastly greenness as the  invisible flyer speeds on its business of ransom.]    [Illustration: _Hans and I hauled out the heavy casket._]      CHAPTER XV    _In the Bandit Camp_    The dark cave, with its small spots of tube-light mounted upon movable  tripods, was eery with grotesque swaying shadows. The bandit camp.  Hidden down here in the depths of the Mid-Atlantic Lowlands. An  inaccessible retreat, this cave in what once was the ocean floor. Only  a few years ago water had been here, water black and cold and  soundless. Tremendous pressure, with three thousand or more fathoms of  the ocean above it. Fishes had roamed these passages, no doubt.  Strange monsters of the deeps: sightless, or with eyes like  phosphorescent torches.    But the water was gone now. Blue ooze was caked upon the cave floor.  Eroded walls; niches and tiny gullies; crevices and an arching dome  high overhead. A fantastic cave--no one, seeing it as I saw it that  morning at dawn, could have believed it was upon this earth. From  where De Boer had put me--on the flat top of a small, butte-like dome  near the upper end of the sloping cave floor--all the area of this  strange bandit camp was visible to me.    A little tent of parchment was set upon the dome-top.    "Yours," said De Boer, with a grin. "Make yourself comfortable.  Gutierrez will be your willing servant, until we see about this  ransom. It will have to be one very large, for you are a damn trouble  to me, Grant. And a risk. Food will come shortly. Then you can sleep:  I think you will want it."    He leaped from the little butte, leaving the taciturn ever-watchful  Gutierrez sitting cross-legged on the ledge near me, with his  projector across his knees.
