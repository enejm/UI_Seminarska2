  'Right, Percy!  Of course that's easy enough.  The 23rd!  That was the  day after Agatha's wedding.  Let me see.  What was I doing?  I came up  in the morning from Woking, and lunched at the club with Charlie  Symons.  Then--oh yes, I dined with the Fishmongers.  I remember, for  the punch didn't agree with me, and I was seedy next morning.  Hang it  all, there's the cigar-box I brought back from the dinner.'  He pointed  to an object on the table, and laughed nervously.    'I think, Sir,' said the young man, addressing me respectfully, 'you  will see you are mistaken.  We want to assist the law like all  Englishmen, and we don't want Scotland Yard to be making fools of  themselves.  That's so, uncle?'    'Certainly, Bob.'  The old fellow seemed to be recovering his voice.  'Certainly, we'll do anything in our power to assist the authorities.  But--but this is a bit too much.  I can't get over it.'    'How Nellie will chuckle,' said the plump man.  'She always said that  you would die of boredom because nothing ever happened to you.  And now  you've got it thick and strong,' and he began to laugh very pleasantly.    'By Jove, yes.  Just think of it!  What a story to tell at the club.  Really, Mr Hannay, I suppose I should be angry, to show my innocence,  but it's too funny!  I almost forgive you the fright you gave me!  You  looked so glum, I thought I might have been walking in my sleep and  killing people.'    It couldn't be acting, it was too confoundedly genuine.  My heart went  into my boots, and my first impulse was to apologize and clear out.  But I told myself I must see it through, even though I was to be the  laughing-stock of Britain.  The light from the dinner-table  candlesticks was not very good, and to cover my confusion I got up,  walked to the door and switched on the electric light.  The sudden  glare made them blink, and I stood scanning the three faces.
