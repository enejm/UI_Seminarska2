At once the Mangaboos began piling up the rocks of glass  again, and as the little man realized that they were all about to be  entombed in the mountain he said to the children:    "My dears, what shall we do? Jump out and fight?"    "What's the use?" replied Dorothy. "I'd as soon die here as live much  longer among those cruel and heartless people."    "That's the way I feel about it," remarked Zeb, rubbing his wounds.  "I've had enough of the Mangaboos."    "All right," said the Wizard; "I'm with you, whatever you decide.

The others agreed readily to this sensible suggestion, and at once the  boy began to harness Jim to the buggy. When all was in readiness the
