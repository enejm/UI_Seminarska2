  At this command the twin captains bowed again to both pairs of rulers  and led Prince Marvel and Nerle from the room.  Then they were escorted  along the streets to the twin houses of the captains, and here the  officers paused and scratched their left ears with uncertain gestures.    "There being only half of each of you," they said, "we do not know how  to lock each of you in double rooms."    "Oh, let us both occupy the same room," said Prince Marvel.  "We prefer  it."

"It is strange," said the prince, thoughtfully, "that the  fierce-looking old Ki should be our friends and the gentle Ki-Ki our  enemies.
