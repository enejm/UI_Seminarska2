“Very much so, madame.”    “Will you then accept that profit, then, on condition of converting the  jewels into money?”    “But you do not intend to sell you diamonds, I suppose, madame?”  exclaimed the bewildered jeweler.    “Silence, M. Faucheux, do not disturb yourself about that; give me an  answer simply. You are an honorable man, with whom my family has dealt  for thirty years; you knew my father and mother, whom your own father  and mother served. I address you as a friend; will you accept the gold  of the settings in return for a sum of ready money to be placed in my  hands?”    “Eight hundred thousand francs! it is enormous.”    “I know it.”    “Impossible to find.”    “Not so.”    “But reflect, madame, upon the effect which will be produced by the sale  of your jewels.”    “No one need know it. You can get sets of false jewels made for me,  similar to the real. Do not answer a word; I insist upon it. Sell them  separately, sell the stones only.”    “In that way it is easy. Monsieur is looking out for some sets of  jewels as well as single stones for Madame’s toilette. There will be  a competition for them. I can easily dispose of six hundred thousand  francs’ worth to Monsieur. I am certain yours are the most beautiful.”    “When can you do so?”    “In less than three days’ time.”    “Very well, the remainder you will dispose of among private individuals.  For the present, make me out a contract of sale, payment to be made in  four days.”    “I entreat you to reflect, madame; for if you force the sale, you will  lose a hundred thousand francs.”    “If necessary, I will lose two hundred; I wish everything to be settled  this evening. Do you accept?”    “I do, your ladyship. I will not conceal from you that I shall make  fifty thousand francs by the transaction.”    “So much the better for you. In what way shall I have the money?”
