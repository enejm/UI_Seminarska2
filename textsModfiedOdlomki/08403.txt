I spoke to them from the vessel, and told them it was the  white man's strongest medicine, and that they were as good as dead men.  Those Kafirs went to the shore in a very great fright, and I do not  think that they will touch champagne again.    Well, all the time that we were steaming up to Natal I was thinking  over Sir Henry Curtis's offer. We did not speak any more on the subject  for a day or two, though I told them many hunting yarns, all true ones.
