 “If those are your orders.”    “Oh, decidedly! We must all be pleasant to our dear Michael.”    “You order me to receive his friends, too, I suppose?”    “The Six?”    “You call them that, too?”    “To be in the fashion, I do. But I order you to receive no one unless  you like.”    “Except yourself?”    “I pray for myself. I could not order.”    As I spoke, there came a cheer from the street. The princess ran to the  window.    “It is he!” she cried. “It is--the Duke of Strelsau!”    I smiled, but said nothing. She returned to her seat. For a few moments  we sat in silence. The noise outside subsided, but I heard the tread of  feet in the ante-room. I began to talk on general subjects. This went on  for some minutes. I wondered what had become of Michael, but it did  not seem to be for me to interfere. All at once, to my great surprise,  Flavia, clasping her hands asked in an agitated voice:    “Are you wise to make him angry?”    “What? Who? How am I making him angry?”    “Why, by keeping him waiting.”    “My dear cousin, I don’t want to keep him--”    “Well, then, is he to come in?”    “Of course, if you wish it.”    She looked at me curiously.    “How funny you are,” she said. “Of course no one could be announced  while I was with you.”    Here was a charming attribute of royalty!    “An excellent etiquette!” I cried. “But I had clean forgotten it; and if  I were alone with someone else, couldn’t you be announced?”    “You know as well as I do. I could be, because I am of the Blood;” and  she still looked puzzled.    “I never could remember all these silly rules,” said I, rather feebly,  as I inwardly cursed Fritz for not posting me up. “But I’ll repair my  fault.”    I jumped up, flung open the door, and advanced into the ante-room.
