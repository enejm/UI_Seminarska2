  "No, I didn't. No one has ever seen it or anything like it. I heard it  and, from its voice, I think it has a bad cold. At least, it sounded  hoarse, so I gave it a little white phosphorus to make a poultice for  its throat, but I didn't get a glimpse of it."    "For God's sake, Doctor, what is it?"    "I can't tell you yet, Major. So far I can tell, it is something new to  science and I am not sure just what it looks like. However, I hope to be  able to show it to you shortly. Is there a telegraph office here?"    "No, but we have a Signal Corps detachment with us, and they have a  portable radio set which will put us in touch with the army net."    "Good! Can you place a tent at my disposal?"    "Certainly, Doctor."    "All right, I'll go there, and I would appreciate it if you would send  the radio operator to me. I want to send a message to the Bureau of  Standards to forward me some apparatus which I need."    "I'll attend to it, Doctor. Have you any special advice to give me about  the guarding?"    "Yes. Have you, or can you get, any live stock?"    "Live stock?"    "Yes. Cattle preferred, although hogs or sheep will do at a pinch. Sheep  will do quite well."    "I'll see what I can do, Doctor."    "Get them by all means, if it is possible to do so. Don't worry about  paying for them: secret service funds are not subject to the same audit  that army funds get. If you can locate them, drive a couple of cattle or  half a dozen sheep well into the cave and tether them there. If you  don't get them, have your sentries posted well away from the cave mouth,  and if any disturbance occurs during the night, tell them to break and  run. I hope it won't come out, but I can't tell."    *       *       *       *       *
