 fortune in scintillating gems which had aroused the cupidity of his  chief and placed the sentence of death upon the head of the lieutenant.    With the escape of the Arabs the great apes had turned their attention  to their fallen comrades.  One was dead, but another and the great  white ape still breathed.  The hairy monsters gathered about these two,  grumbling and muttering after the fashion of their kind.    Tarzan was the first to regain consciousness.  Sitting up, he looked  about him.  Blood was flowing from a wound in his shoulder.  The shock  had thrown him down and dazed him; but he was far from dead.  Rising  slowly to his feet he let his eyes wander toward the spot where last he  had seen the she, who had aroused within his savage breast such strange  emotions.    "Where is she?" he asked.    "The Tarmangani took her away," replied one of the apes.  "Who are you  who speak the language of the Mangani?"    "I am Tarzan," replied the ape-man; "mighty hunter, greatest of  fighters.  When I roar, the jungle is silent and trembles with terror.  I am Tarzan of the Apes.  I have been away; but now I have come back to  my people."    "Yes," spoke up an old ape, "he is Tarzan.  I know him.  It is well  that he has come back.  Now we shall have good hunting."    The other apes came closer and sniffed at the ape-man.  Tarzan stood  very still, his fangs half bared, and his muscles tense and ready for  action; but there was none there to question his right to be with them,  and presently, the inspection satisfactorily concluded, the apes again  returned their attention to the other survivor.    He too was but slightly wounded, a bullet, grazing his skull, having  stunned him, so that when he regained consciousness he was apparently  as fit as ever.    The apes told Tarzan that they had been traveling toward the east when  the scent spoor of the she had attracted them and they had stalked her.
