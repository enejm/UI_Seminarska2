(the width of the circle itself), or a total of six hundred feet from  the rounded extremity of one ray or petal to the extremity of the  opposite one. {Endnote 14}    The building itself is of pure and polished white marble, which shows  out in marvellous contrast to the red granite of the frowning city, on  whose brow it glistens indeed like an imperial diadem upon the forehead  of a dusky queen. The outer surface of the dome and of the twelve petal  courts is covered entirely with thin sheets of beaten gold; and from the  extreme point of the roof of each of these petals a glorious golden form  with a trumpet in its hand and widespread wings is figured in the very  act of soaring into space. I really must leave whoever reads this to  imagine the surpassing beauty of these golden roofs flashing when the  sun strikes--flashing like a thousand fires aflame on a mountain of  polished marble--so fiercely that the reflection can be clearly seen  from the great peaks of the range a hundred miles away.    It is a marvellous sight--this golden flower upborne upon the cool white  marble walls, and I doubt if the world can show such another.
