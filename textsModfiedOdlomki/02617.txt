metal ladder.    As we climbed, I could hear the haunting melody of Mildred's wordless  song coming faint across the distance. Once I glanced back for a  moment, and glimpsed her tiny white figure above the black water, with  the thousands of green antennae rising in a luminous forest about her.    We reached the top of the cliff, where the opalescent river plunged  down in the flaming fall. Ray chose convenient boulders for shelter  and quickly we flung ourselves flat.
