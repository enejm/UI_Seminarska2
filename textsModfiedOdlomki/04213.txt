and kissed her. "Together, forever. Just you and me."    Nanlo sighed, with luxuriant happiness, and peered at his radiumite  wrist watch.    "The five minutes are up," she murmured. "Can't we go now?"    Hugh Neils nodded.    "We've waited plenty long enough," he decided. "The guard will be  asleep by now. The crew were that way when I left them, in the  dormitory.
