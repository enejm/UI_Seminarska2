  "When I am through with him," replied Tarzan, quietly.    The officer turned and beckoned to the soldiers standing in the trail  behind him.  A company of uniformed blacks stepped quickly forward and  pushing past the three, surrounded the ape-man and his captive.    "Both the law and the power to enforce it are upon my side," announced  the officer.  "Let us have no trouble.  If you have a grievance against  this man you may return with me and enter your charge regularly before  an authorized tribunal."    "Your legal rights are not above suspicion, my friend," replied Tarzan,  "and your power to enforce your commands are only apparent--not real.

And what assurance have  you that I cannot bring an armed force about you that will prevent your  return to the Congo Free State?"    The Belgian lost his temper.

"She cannot be far from here at this very minute."    The soldiers, following the signal from their sergeant, closed in to  seize Werper.  Tarzan grabbed the Belgian about the waist, and bearing  him beneath his arm as he might have borne a sack of flour, leaped  forward in an attempt to break through the cordon.  His right fist  caught the nearest soldier upon the jaw and sent him hurtling backward  upon his fellows.  Clubbed rifles were torn from the hands of those who  barred his way, and right and left the black soldiers stumbled aside in  the face of the ape-man's savage break for liberty.    So completely did the blacks surround the two that they dared not fire
