accession to your estates.”    “Nor can I say that either,” I replied, with the same heat.  “It is a  good estate; what matters that to a lone man that has enough already?  I  had a good revenue before in my frugality; and but for the man’s  death—which gratifies me, shame to me that must confess it!—I see not how  anyone is to be bettered by this change.”    “Come, come,” said he, “you are more affected than you let on, or you  would never make yourself out so lonely.
