Engineering Class.    They put in a few months' work and sent home unanimous Crash Priority  reports the situation is _bad_, getting worse and the prognosis is  War.    Brother.    I know people had wars, I know one reason we do not have them now is  just that with so many planets and cheap transportation, pressure has  other outlets; these people scrapped their ships for factories and  never built more.    But.    There are only about ten million of them and surely to goodness a  whole planet gives room enough to keep out of each other's hair?    Well this is not Reasoning but a Reaction, I go back to the data for  another look.    The root trouble is stated to be that two groups landed on the planet  without knowing the others were there, when they met thirty years  later they got a disagreeable shock.    I cannot see there was any basic difference between them, they were  very similar, especially in that neither lot wanted anything to do  with people they had not picked themselves.    So they divided the planet along a Great Circle which left two of the  main land-masses in one hemisphere and two in another.    They agree each to keep to its own section and leave the other alone.    Twenty years later, trading like mad; each has certain minerals the  other lacks; each has certain agricultural products the other finds it  difficult to grow.

I will not go into the incidents that make each side feel it is being  gypped, it is enough that from time to time each has a scarcity or  hold-up on deliveries that upsets the other's economy; and they start  experimenting to become self-sufficient: and the exporter's economy is  upset in turn. And each thinks the other did it on purpose.    This sort of situation reacts internally leading to Politics.    There are troubles about a medium-sized island on the dividing line,  and the profits from interhemispherical transport, and the laws of
