   Here Foulata, who had been in a state of great fear and agitation  throughout, said that she felt faint and could go no farther, but would  wait there. Accordingly we set her down on the unfinished wall, placing  the basket of provisions by her side, and left her to recover.    Following the passage for about fifteen paces farther, we came suddenly  to an elaborately painted wooden door. It was standing wide open.  Whoever was last there had either not found the time to shut it, or had  forgotten to do so.    _Across the threshold of this door lay a skin bag, formed of a  goat-skin, that appeared to be full of pebbles._    "_Hee! hee!_ white men," sniggered Gagool, as the light from the lamp  fell upon it.

How many  of them there were we did not know, for of course we could not see to  what depth they went back, but there could not have been less than the  ends of four or five hundred tusks of the first quality visible to our
