“It is beyond my judging,” I replied.  “It will be long, it may be  never.”    “It may be so,” said she.  “And you are sorry?”    I bowed my head, looking upon her.    “So am I, at all events,” said she.  “I have seen you but a small time,  but I put you very high.  You are true, you are brave; in time I think  you will be more of a man yet.  I will be proud to hear of that.  If you  should speed worse, if it will come to fall as we are afraid—O well!  think you have the one friend.  Long after you are dead and me an old  wife, I will be telling the bairns about David Balfour, and my tears  running.  I will be telling how we parted, and what I said to you, and  did to you.  _God go with you and guide you_, _prays your little friend_:  so I said—I will be telling them—and here is what I did.”    She took up my hand and kissed it.  This so surprised my spirits that I  cried out like one hurt.  The colour came strong in her face, and she  looked at me and nodded.    “O yes, Mr. David,” said she, “that is what I think of you.  The head  goes with the lips.”    I could read in her face high spirit, and a chivalry like a brave  child’s; not anything besides.  She kissed my hand, as she had kissed  Prince Charlie’s, with a higher passion than the common kind of clay has  any sense of.  Nothing before had taught me how deep I was her lover, nor  how far I had yet to climb to make her think of me in such a character.  Yet I could tell myself I had advanced some way, and that her heart had  beat and her blood flowed at thoughts of me.    After that honour she had done me I could offer no more trivial civility.  It was even hard for me to speak; a certain lifting in her voice had  knocked directly at the door of my own tears.
