How the Story of Oz Came to an End          Author's Note      Perhaps I should admit on the title page that this book is "By L.  Frank Baum and his correspondents," for I have used many suggestions  conveyed to me in letters from children.  Once on a time I really  imagined myself "an author of fairy tales," but now I am merely an  editor or private secretary for a host of youngsters whose ideas I am  requestsed to weave into the thread of my stories.    These ideas are often clever.  They are also logical and interesting.  So I have used them whenever I could find an opportunity, and it is but  just that I acknowledge my indebtedness to my little friends.    My, what imaginations these children have developed!  Sometimes I am  fairly astounded by their daring and genius.  There will be no lack of  fairy-tale authors in the future, I am sure.  My readers have told me  what to do with Dorothy, and Aunt Em and Uncle Henry, and I have obeyed  their mandates.  They have also given me a variety of subjects to write  about in the future: enough, in fact, to keep me busy for some time.  I  am very proud of this alliance.  Children love these stories because  children have helped to create them.  My readers know what they want  and realize that I try to please them.  The result is very satisfactory
