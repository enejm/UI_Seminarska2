  From the boat the business appeared yet more precarious than from the  ship, she stood so high over us, swung down so swift, and menaced us so  perpetually with her plunging and passaging upon the anchor cable.  I  began to think I had made a fool’s bargain, that it was merely impossible  Catriona should be got on board to me, and that I stood to be set ashore  at Helvoet all by myself and with no hope of any reward but the pleasure  of embracing James More, if I should want to.  But this was to reckon  without the lass’s courage.  She had seen me leap with very little  appearance (however much reality) of hesitation; to be sure, she was not  to be beat by her discarded friend.

There was no minute  lost, and scarce time given for any to interfere if they had wished the  same.  I stood up on the other side and spread my arms; the ship swung  down on us, the patroon humoured his boat nearer in than was perhaps  wholly safe, and Catriona leaped into the air.

No more did I; and indeed the whistling of the wind  and the breaching of the sprays made it no time for speech; and our crew  not only toiled excessively but made extremely little way, so that the  _Rose_ had got her anchor and was off again before we had approached the
