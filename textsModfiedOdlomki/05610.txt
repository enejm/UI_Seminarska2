 Ripped. Mangled. By spears the things carry. Dead like that."    "Yes," murmured Ken, "that would do it...."    "I quick tried to get away," gasped Sallorsen. "Full-speed--back and  forth. No good. Ropes held. Couldn't break. All our power couldn't! So  then--then I acted foolishly. Damn foolish. But we were all a little  crazy. A nightmare, you know. Couldn't believe our eyes--those seals  outside, mocking us. So I called for volunteers. Four men. Put 'em in  sea-suits, gave 'em shears and grappling prongs. They went out.    "They went out laughing--saying they'd soon have us free! Oh, God!" It  seemed he could not go on, but he forced the words out deliberately.  "Killed without a chance! Ripped apart like the others! No chance!  Suicide!"    Ken felt the agony in the man, and was silent for a while before  quietly asking:    "Did they kill any more of the sealmen?"    "One. Just one. That made two of them--six of us. What the hell are  the rest of them waiting for?" Sallorsen cried. "They killed eight in  all! To our two! That's enough for them, isn't it?"    "I'm afraid not," said Ken Torrance. "Well, what then?"    "Sat down and thought. Carefully. Hit on a plan. Took one of our two  torpoons. Lashed on it steel plates, ground to sharp cutting edges.  Spent days at it. Thought torpoon could go out and cut the ropes.  Haines volunteered and we shot him and torpoon out."    "They got the torpoon?" Ken asked.    Sallorsen's arm raised in a pointing gesture. "Look."    *       *       *       *       *    Some fifty feet away from the _Peary_, on the side opposite to the one  Ken Torrance had approached, a dimly discernible object lay in the  mud. In miniature, it resembled the submarine: a cigar-shaped steel  shell, held down to the sea-bottom by ropes bound over it. Cutting  edges of steel had been fastened along its length.
