“My brother is now Lord Burlesdon,” said I.    “Thy head betrayeth thee,” he chuckled, pointing to my uncovered poll.  “Why, Fritz, you know the story?”    The young man glanced apologetically at me. He felt a delicacy which  my sister-in-law would have admired. To put him at his ease, I remarked  with a smile:    “Ah! the story is known here as well as among us, it seems.”    “Known!” cried Sapt. “If you stay here, the deuce a man in all Ruritania  will doubt of it--or a woman either.”    I began to feel uncomfortable.
