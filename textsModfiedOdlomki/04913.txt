both of them.    "Then it wasn't the engines, but the pumps," she said.    "And it wasn't the steam, but the fire," screamed Mrs. Assistant. "Oh,  dear, how that captain lied, and I thought him such a nice man, too.  Oh, I shall go into hysterics, I know I shall."    "I wouldn't if I were you," said the sensible Mrs. General, who was a  strong-minded woman; "besides, it is too late. We're all safe now. I  think both captains were pretty sensible men. Evidently married, both  of 'em."    Which was quite true.          THE DEPARTURE OF CUB MCLEAN.      Of course no one will believe me when I say that Mellish was in every  respect, except one, an exemplary citizen and a good-hearted man. He  was generous to a fault and he gave many a young fellow a start in life  where a little money or a few encouraging words were needed. He drank,  of course, but he was a connoisseur in liquors, and a connoisseur never  goes in for excess. Few could tell a humorous story as well as Mellish,  and he seldom dealt in chestnuts. No man can be wholly bad who never  inflicts an old story on his friends, locating it on some acquaintance  of his, and alleging that it occurred the day before.    If I wished to write a heart-rending article on the evils of gambling,  Mellish would be the man I would go to for my facts and for the moral  of the tale. He spent his life persuading people not to gamble. He  never gambled himself, he said. But if no attention was paid to his  advice, why then he furnished gamblers with the most secluded and  luxurious gambling rooms in the city. It was supposed that Mellish  stood in with the police, which was, of course, a libel. The idea of  the guardians of the city standing in with a gambler or a gambling  house! The statement was absurd on the face of it. If you asked any  policeman in the city where Mellish's gambling rooms were, you would  speedily learn that not one of them had ever even heard of the place.
