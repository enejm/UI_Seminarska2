Monsieur de Bragelonne, that although I possess half of her nature, I do  not share her happiness. But let us now speak of yourself; whom do you  love in France?”    “A young girl, as soft and pure as a lily.”    “But if she loves you, why are you sad?”    “I have been told that she ceases to love me.”    “You do not believe it, I trust?”    “He who wrote me so does not sign his letter.”    “An anonymous denunciation! some treachery, be assured,” said Miss  Grafton.    “Stay,” said Raoul, showing the young girl a letter which he had read  over a thousand times; she took it from his hand and read as follows:    “VICOMTE,--You are perfectly right to amuse yourself yonder with the  lovely faces of Charles II.’s court, for at Louis XIV.’s court, the  castle in which your affections are enshrined is being besieged. Stay in  London altogether, poor vicomte, or return without delay to Paris.”    “There is no signature,” said Miss Mary.    “None.”    “Believe it not, then.”    “Very good; but here is a second letter, from my friend De Guiche, which  says, ‘I am lying here wounded and ill. Return, Raoul, oh, return!’”    “What do you intend doing?” inquired the young girl, with a feeling of  oppression at her heart.    “My intention, as soon as I received this letter, was immediately to  take my leave of the king.”    “When did you receive it?”    “The day before yesterday.”    “It is dated Fontainebleau.”    “A singular circumstance, do you not think, for the court is now at  Paris? At all events, I would have set off; but when I mentioned my  intention to the king, he began to laugh, and said to me, ‘How comes  it, monsieur l’amassadeur, that you think of leaving? Has your sovereign  recalled you?’ I colored, naturally enough, for I was confused by the  question; for the fact is, the king himself sent me here, and I have  received no order to return.”    Mary frowned in deep thought, and said, “Do you remain, then?”
