  "Here it is," he said, "but I must confess that I don't understand the  numbers."    He handed it to Bones. It read:    "Mercutio 17178."    Bones looked at it a moment, then gasped. He reached out his hand  solemnly and grasped that of the astounded Hamilton.    "Dear old fellow," he said in a broken voice, "Congratulate me, I have  drawn a runner!"    "A runner?"    "A runner, dear old sport," chortled Bones, "in the Cambridgeshire! You  see I've got a ticket number seventeen, seventeen eight in my pocket,  dear old friend! If Mercutio wins," he repeated solemnly, "I will stand  you the finest dinner that can be secured this side of Romano's."          CHAPTER VI    THE SOUL OF THE NATIVE WOMAN      Mail day is ever a day of supreme interest for the young and for the  matter of that for the middle-aged, too. Sanders hated mail days because  the bulk of his correspondence had to do with Government, and Government  never sat down with a pen in its hand to wish Sanders many happy returns  of the day or to tell him scandalous stories about mutual friends.    Rather the Government (by inference) told him scandalous stories about  himself--of work not completed to the satisfaction of Downing Street--a  thoroughfare given to expecting miracles.    Hamilton had a sister who wrote wittily and charmingly every week, and  there was another girl ... Still, two letters and a bright pink paper or  two made a modest postbag by the side of Lieutenant Tibbetts' mail.    There came to Bones every mail day a thick wad of letters and parcels  innumerable, and he could sit at the big table for hours on end,  whistling a little out of tune, mumbling incoherently. He had a trick of  commenting upon his letters aloud, which was very disconcerting for  Hamilton. Bones wouldn't open a letter and get half-way through it  before he began his commenting.
