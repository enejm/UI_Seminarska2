The palavers he called had a deeper significance to the men who attended  them than purely geographical inquiries. Thus, the folk of the Isisi  planning a little raid upon certain Akasava fishermen, who had  established themselves unlawfully upon the Isisi river-line, put away  their spears and folded their hands when N'bosini was mentioned, because  Bones was unconsciously probing their excuse before they advanced it.    Idigi, himself, who, in his caution, had prepared Hamilton for some  slight difference of opinion between his own tribe and the N'gombi of  the interior, read into the earnest inquiries of Lieutenant Tibbetts,  something more than a patient spirit of research.    All that Hamilton had set his subordinate to accomplish Bones was doing,  though none was more in ignorance of the fact than himself, and, since  all men owed a grudge to the Ochori, palavers, which had as their object  an investigation into the origin of the N'bosini legend, invariably  ended in the suggestion rather than the statement that the only  authority upon this mysterious land, and the still more mysterious tribe  who inhabited it, was Bosambo of the Ochori.

In an emerald-green robe with twelve sox suspenders strapped about his  legs and dangling tags a-glitter--he had bought these on his visit to  the Coast--with an umbrella of state and six men carrying a canopy over  his august person, he came down to the beach to greet the
