Imee, watching me through the lights of my head-piece, nodded and  smiled.    Yes, this was the very hulk by which she had been swimming when the  shark had attacked her, the shark which had been the cause of the  accident. She darted on to show me the very rib upon which her head  had struck, stunning her so that she had drifted, unconscious and  storm-tossed, to the shore of Mercer's estate.    I studied the wreck.
