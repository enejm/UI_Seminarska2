  "Looking for someone, young man?"    "Just information, Mrs.--"    "Collins, and it's Miss. Don't give out information about guests. You a  bill collector?"    "No, Miss Collins. As a matter of fact, I'm trying to check up on an old  friend I lost track of. Helen Simmons. She lived at this address for a  while."    "Sure did. Well, come on in. Mind you, I don't usually do this, Mr.--"    "Blair." Without any fanfare a bill changed hands.    "Mr. Blair. Well, I can't tell you much. Try that green chair for size.  What do you want to know?"    *       *       *       *       *    Jim studied the toe of his right shoe. His eyes were veiled. "I heard  she was hurt, and hard up, and I was worried. My wife and I were friends  of hers back east."    "Hurt, hard up? Humph! Not likely, spendin' all her time drivin' that  English car around. Takin' trips. I'm not sayin' she didn't mind her  manners, though."    "Did she have any close friends?"    "She was chummy with Edith Walton, the girl that works for Doc Mendel.  He's county coroner in his spare time. No men. Didn't fool around at  all. I'd a known."    *       *       *       *       *    Behind Jim's stony eyes the pattern took clearer form, as if a mosaic  approached completion. A mosaic of carefully planned events that  totalled horror. He shivered as the outlines of his hunch filled in.  Helen--what creatures were these? Helen--not dead, not poor,--carefully  planting ostensible proof of her death and going on to a new role, a new  life, in London or Paris or Rome. A free, untrammelled life. And her  child--if child was the word--in his home, repeating the pattern.
