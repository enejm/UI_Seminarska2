Iapetus and provoked the vengeance of the Hawk....          CHAPTER III    _Death Rides the Star Devil_      Usually, when pursuing an enemy, Hawk Carse was impassive and grim,  apparently emotionless, icy. But now he seemed somehow disturbed.    He fidgeted around, glancing occasionally at the visi-screen to make  sure his quarry was not changing course, now watching Friday juggle  through the skin of atmosphere into outer space, and now standing  apart, silent and solitary, brooding.    There was something about the affair he didn't like. Something that  was deeply hidden, that could not be grasped clearly; that might, on  the other hand, be pure imagination.
