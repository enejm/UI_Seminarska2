race, live apart from us at S'furi-S'foosi, and were we not prosperous  in those days? Now tell us what man you will set over us."    For one moment Sanders was nonplussed. He was rapidly reviewing the  qualifications of all the little chiefs, the headmen, and the fisher  leaders who sat under him, and none fulfilled his requirements.    In that moment of silence an agitated voice whispered in his ear, and  Bones's lean hand clutched his sleeve.    "Sir an' Excellency," breathed Bones, all of a twitter, "don't think I'm  takin' advantage of my position, but it's the chance I've been lookin'  for, sir. You'd do me an awful favour--you see, sir, I've got his career  to consider----"    "What on earth----" began Sanders.    "Henry Hamilton Bones, sir," said Bones tremulously. "You'd set him up  for life, sir. I must think of the child, hang it all! I know I'm a  jolly old rotter to put my spoke in----"    Sanders gently released the frenzied grip of his lieutenant, and faced  the wondering palaver.    "Know all people that this day I give to you as king one whom you shall  call M'songuri, which means in your tongue 'The Young and the Wise,' and  who is called in my tongue N'risu M'ilitani Tibbetti, and this one is a  child and well beloved by my lord Tibbetti, being to him as a son, and  by M'ilitani and by me, Sandi."    He raised his hand in challenge.    "Wa! Whose men are you?" he cried.    "M'songuri!"    The answer came in a deep-throated growl, and the assembly leapt to its  feet.    "Wa! Who rules this land?"    "M'songuri!"    They locked arms and stamped first with the right foot and then with the  left, in token of their acceptance.    "Take your king," said Sanders, "and build him a beautiful hut, and his  spirit shall dwell with you. This palaver is finished."    Bones was speechless all the way down river. At irregular intervals he  would grip Sanders's hand, but he was too full for speech.
