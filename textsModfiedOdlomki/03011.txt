for us and make us some real money."    "Con man? Oh. A slipstring."    "A con by any other name," said Matheny, pouring down an akvavit.    *       *       *       *       *    Doran squinted through cigarette smoke. "You are interesting me  strangely, my friend. Say on."    "No." Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth  seemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an  odd quality.    "No, sorry, Gus," he said. "I spoke too much."    "Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb  out of here, how about it? Go have a little fun."    "By all means." Matheny disposed of his last beer. "I could use some  gaiety."    "You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room  first and some more up-to-date clothes."    "_Allez_," said Matheny. "If I don't mean _allons_, or maybe _alors_."    The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered  him; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more.    _Oh, well_, he thought, _if I succeed in this job, no one at home will  quibble._    And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular  enough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to  show the vertical incandescence of the towers.    "Whoof!" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his  contours. He jumped. "What the dusty hell--Oh." He tried to grin, but  his face burned. "I see."    "That is a sexy type of furniture, all right," agreed Doran. He lowered  himself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a  cigarette. "Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not  too late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around  2100 hours earliest."
