 which--and we want you to tell us."    Braun's aristocratic eyebrows went up. "Me? Hell, Andy, I don't know  nothing about things like that. I'm surprised with you. I thought CIA  had all the brains it needed--ain't you got machines to tell you answers  like that?"    I pointed silently to Joan, who had gone back to work the moment the  introductions were over. She was still on the mike to the divers. She  was saying: "What does it look like?"    "It's just a lump of something, Dr. Hadamard. Can't even tell its  shape--it's buried too deeply in the mud." _Cloonk_ ... _Oing_, _oing_  ...    "Try the Geiger."    "We did. Nothing but background."    "Scintillation counter?"

But why should you guess wrong? Your hunches  have been working for sixty years now."    Braun wiped his face. "No. You don't get it. I wish you'd listen to me.
