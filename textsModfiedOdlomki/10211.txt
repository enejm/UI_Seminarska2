Sanders nodded slowly. "Why did you not send for me?"    For a moment the squatting figure made no reply, then he rose and  stretched himself.    "Master," he said, speaking in Arabic--which is a language which allows  of nice distinctions--"this man was happy; he walked in the Forest of  Happy Thoughts; why should I call him back to a land where there was  neither sunshine nor happiness, but only night and pain and sickness?"
