  "I want what I have always wanted: I want you for my wife."    She looked at him with stupid amazement, as if the real meaning of this  already once declared desire had only just distinctly reached her mind,  or as if the effect of its first announcement had been quite effaced by  the succeeding outburst.    "Why, I thought you knew! You can't have heard--about me," she said.    "I have heard, I know all," he exclaimed, taking a step forward and  standing over her. "Forgive me, darling! forgive me for being almost glad  when I heard that you were free, and not married out of my reach. I can't  think of anything except that I've found you. It is you, isn't it? It is  you. I don't care what's happened to you, if it is only you."    As he spoke in this vehement, fiery way, she had been regarding him with  an expression of faint curiosity. "I believe you do really mean it," she  said, wonderingly, lingering over the words; "you always were a queer  fellow."    "Mean it!" he exclaimed, kneeling before her, his voice all tremulous  with the hope which the slightly yielding intonation of her words had  given him. "Yes--yes--I mean it."    The faint ghost of a smile, which only brought out the sadness of her  face, as a taper in a crypt reveals its gloom, hovered about her eyes.    "Poor boy!" she said; "I've, treated you very badly. I was going to make  an end of myself this afternoon, but I will wait till you are tired of  your fancy for me. It will make but little difference. There! there!  Please don't kiss me."          CHAPTER VIII.      He did not insist on their marriage taking place at once, although in her  mood of dull indifference she would not have objected to anything he  might have proposed. It was his hope that after a while she might become  calmer, and more cheerful. He hoped to take in his at the altar a hand a  little less like that of a dead person.
