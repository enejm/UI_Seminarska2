It was near midnight when Snap and I closed and sealed the helio-room  and started for the chart-room, where we were to meet with Captain  Carter and the other officers. The passengers had nearly all retired. A  game was in progress in the smoking room, but the deck was almost  deserted.    Snap and I were passing along one of the interior corridors. The  stateroom doors, with the illumined names of the passengers, were all  closed. The metal grid of the floor echoed our footsteps. Snap was in  advance of me. His body suddenly rose in the air. He went like a balloon  to the ceiling, struck it gently, and all in a heap came floating down  and landed on the floor!    "What in the infernal!--"    He was laughing as he picked himself up. But it was a brief laugh. We  knew what had happened: the artificial gravity-controls in the base of  the ship, which by magnetic force gave us normality aboard, were being  tampered with! For just this instant, this particular small section of  this corridor had been cut off. The slight bulk of the Planetara,  floating in space, had no appreciable gravity pull on Snap's body, and  the impulse of his step as he came to the unmagnetized area of the  corridor had thrown him to the ceiling. The area was normal now. Snap  and I tested it gingerly.    He gripped me. "That never went wrong by accident, Gregg! Someone down  there--"    *       *       *       *       *    We rushed to the nearest descending ladder. In the deserted lower room  the bank of dials stood neglected. A score of dials and switches were  here, governing the magnetism of different areas of the ship. There  should have been a night operator, but he was gone.    Then we saw him lying nearby, sprawled face down on the floor! In the  silence and dim lurid glow of the fluorescent tubes, we stood holding  our breaths, peering and listening. No one here.
