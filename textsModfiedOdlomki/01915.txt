Hurrying to the other end of the room, he reached into a large flat  metal cage and brought forth three small rodent like animals, natives of  that world. These he also tossed carelessly under the glass.    "Fauna," he grunted, and picked up the tiny metal vial.    One end of the vial unscrewed. He turned the cap gently, carefully, a  strained, anxious look upon his face.
