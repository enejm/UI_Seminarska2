said, moved chiefly by a desire to oppose Lattimer.    "Yes, but think of the snafu in the halls, every time they changed  classes. It'd take half an hour to get everybody back and forth from one  floor to another." He turned to von Ohlmhorst. "I'm going up above this  floor. This place has been looted clean up to here, but there's a chance  there may be something above," he said.    "I'll stay on this floor, at present," the Turco-German replied. "There  will be much coming and going, and dragging things in and out. We should  get this completely examined and recorded first. Then Major Lindemann's  people can do their worst, here."    "Well, if nobody else wants it, I'll take the downstairs," Martha said.    "I'll go along with you," Hubert Penrose told her. "If the lower floors  have no archaeological value, we'll turn them into living quarters. I  like this building: it'll give everybody room to keep out from under  everybody else's feet." He looked down the hall. "We ought to find  escalators at the middle."    *       *       *       *       *    The hallway, too, was thick underfoot with dust. Most of the open rooms  were empty, but a few contained furniture, including small seat-desks.  The original proponent of the university theory pointed these out as  just what might be found in classrooms. There were escalators, up and  down, on either side of the hall, and more on the intersecting passage  to the right.    "That's how they handled the students, between classes," Martha  commented. "And I'll bet there are more ahead, there."    They came to a stop where the hallway ended at a great square central  hall. There were elevators, there, on two of the sides, and four  escalators, still usable as stairways. But it was the walls, and the  paintings on them, that brought them up short and staring.    They were clouded with dirt--she was trying to imagine what they must  have looked like originally, and at the same time estimating the labor
