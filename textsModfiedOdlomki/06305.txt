  "No."    "Then what are you doing here?"    "I was looking for you, Harry."    "You know my name?"    She nodded again. "Dr. Manschoff told me."    "You mean, he sent you here to find me?"    "That's right."    "But I don't understand. If you're not going swimming, then why--I  mean--"    Her smile broadened. "It's just part of the therapy, Harry."    "Part of the therapy?"    "That's right. _Part._" She giggled. "Don't you think you'd like to  come out of the water now and see what the rest of it might be?"    Harry thought so.    *       *       *       *       *    With mounting enthusiasm, he eagerly embraced his treatment and  entered into a state of active cooperation.    It was some time before he ventured to comment on the situation.  "Manschoff is a damned good diagnostician," he murmured. Then he sat  up. "Are you a patient here?"    She shook her head. "Don't ask questions, Harry. Can't you be  satisfied with things as they are?"    "You're just what the doctor ordered, all right." He gazed down at  her. "But don't you even have a name?"    "You can call me Sue."    "Thank you."    He bent to kiss her but she avoided him and rose to her feet. "Got to  go now."    "So soon?"    She nodded and moved towards the bushes above the bank.    "But when will I see you again?"    "Coming swimming tomorrow?"    "Yes."    "Maybe I can get away for more occupational therapy then."    She stooped behind the bushes, and Harry saw a flash of white.    "You _are_ a nurse, aren't you," he muttered. "On the staff, I  suppose. I should have known."    "All right, so I am. What's that got to do with it?"
