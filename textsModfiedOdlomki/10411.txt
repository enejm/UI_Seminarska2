it!"    Sanders pushed the young scientist aside and looked. When he turned his  head, the girl saw his face was white and drawn, and for a moment a  sense of panic overcame her.    "You silly ass," growled the Commissioner, "they aren't trypnosomes! You  haven't cleaned the infernal eyepiece!"    "Not trypnosomes?" said Bones.    "You seem disappointed, Bones," said Hamilton.    "As a man, I'm overjoyed," replied Bones gloomily; "as a scientist, it's  a set-back, dear old officer--a distinct set-back."    The house-warming lasted a much shorter time than the host had intended.  This was largely due to the failure of a very beautiful experiment which  he had projected. In order that the rare and wonderful result at which  he aimed should be achieved, Bones had the hut artificially darkened,  and they sat in a hot and sticky blackness, whilst he knocked over  bottles and swore softly at the instruments his groping hand could not  discover. And the end of the experiment was a large, bad smell.    "The women and children first," said Hamilton, and dived for the door.    They took farewell of Bones at a respectful distance.    Hamilton went across to the Houssa lines, and Sanders walked back to the  Residency with the girl. For a little while they spoke of Bones and his  newest craze, and then suddenly the girl asked--    "You didn't really think there were any of those funny things in my  blood, did you?"    Sanders looked straight ahead.    "I thought--you see, we know--the tryp is a distinct little body, and  anybody who had lived in this part of the world for a time can pick him  out. Bones, of course, knows nothing thoroughly--I should have  remembered that."    She said nothing until they reached the verandah, and she turned to go  to her room.    "It wasn't nice, was it?" she said.    Sanders shook his head.    "It was a taste of hell," he said simply. And she fetched a quick, long  sigh and patted his arm before she realized what she was doing.
