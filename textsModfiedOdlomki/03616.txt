sensible plan. Then he began trying to organize what he had seen and  heard during his stay on the planet. At night, Kielgaard helped him and  together they went over their theories, trying to find those that would  fit the facts of Porcys.    "It all hinges on population pressure," said Kielgaard finally. "On  most planets we know of, overpopulation leads to war, starvation,  birth control or emigration. These are the only ways. At least, they  were, till we discovered Porcys."    *       *       *       *       *    "All right," agreed Dan. "Grant that. The Porcyns plainly don't have  any of those things, or not to any great extent. Instead, they have  institutions such as we've never seen before. They have 'sweepers,'  so-called 'vacations' and a rope from building to building. All these  things cut down population."    "Don't forget their 'truth chairs,'" said Kielgaard.    "Where you either tell the truth or get converted to ashes--yes. But  how does it all fit in?"    "Let's take one individual as an example. Start at birth."    "He's born," said Dan. "Probably they have nurseries, but we know they  stick together as families, because we have the Milbuns to go by. He  grows up, living at his parents' place. He goes with other children to  school or to see different parts of his city. A lion--which he calls a  'dog'--protects him."    "Yes," said Kielgaard. "It protects him from sweepers. But most  grownups don't need protection. Only those whose charge is low."    "Of course. The boy hasn't been on vacation yet. He's not radioactive.  Apparently you have to be radioactive to open doors. At the apartment  house, the boy comes in a small door to one side. The lions, or what  resemble lions, like the children but don't like the sweepers. And the  sweepers are afraid of them. All right. But what about when he grows  up?"    "Well, for one thing, he has to use the regular doors now. And they
