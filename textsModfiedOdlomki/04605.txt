After he had beaten his wife thoroughly for her foolishness, Zotul  stamped off in a rage and designed a new ceramic stove, one that would  accommodate the terrestrial pots very well.    And Koltan put the model into production.    "Orders already are pouring in like mad," he said the next day. "It  was wise of you to foresee it and have the design ready. Already, I am  sorry for thinking as I did about the Earthmen. They really intend to  do well by us."    The kilns of the Pottery of Masur fired day and night to keep up with  the demand for the new porcelain stoves. In three years, more than a  million had been made and sold by the Masurs alone, not counting the  hundreds of thousands of copies turned out by competitors in every  land.    *       *       *       *       *    In the meantime, however, more things than pots came from Earth.

And the business  of the House of Masur continued to look up.    "As I have always said from the beginning," chortled Director Koltan,
