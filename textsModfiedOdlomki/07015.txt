driven into a corner and forced to do so. Secretly the warriors of  Pal-ul-don held the emasculated priesthood in contempt and so instead  of immediately taking up the offensive as they would have had the two  men been warriors from A-lur instead of priests, they waited to  question them.    At sight of the warriors the priests made the sign of peace and upon  being asked if they were alone they answered in the affirmative.    The leader of Mo-sar's warriors permitted them to approach.  "What do  you here," he asked, "in the country of Mo-sar, so far from your own  city?"    "We carry a message from Lu-don, the high priest, to Mo-sar," explained  one.    "Is it a message of peace or of war?" asked the warrior.    "It is an offer of peace," replied the priest.    "And Lu-don is sending no warriors behind you?" queried the fighting  man.    "We are alone," the priest assured him. "None in A-lur save Lu-don  knows that we have come upon this errand."    "Then go your way," said the warrior.    "Who is that?" asked one of the priests suddenly, pointing toward the  upper end of the lake at the point where the river from Jad-bal-lul  entered it.    All eyes turned in the direction that he had indicated to see a lone  warrior paddling rapidly into Jad-in-lul, the prow of his canoe  pointing toward Tu-lur. The warriors and the priests drew into the  concealment of the bushes on either side of the portage.    "It is the terrible man who called himself the Dor-ul-Otho," whispered  one of the priests. "I would know that figure among a great multitude  as far as I could see it."    "You are right, priest," cried one of the warriors who had seen Tarzan  the day that he had first entered Ko-tan's palace. "It is indeed he who  has been rightly called Tarzan-jad-guru."    "Hasten priests," cried the leader of the party. "You are two paddles  in a light canoe. Easily can you reach Tu-lur ahead of him and warn  Mo-sar of his coming, for he has but only entered the lake."
