  By this time, what between fright and struggling, I was pretty well  tired. I cannot remember how I got from under the fallen tree, or indeed  anything, until I found myself sitting on the ground drinking some peach  brandy from a flask, and old Indaba-zimbi opposite to me nodding  his white lock sagely, while he fired off moral reflections on the  narrowness of my escape, and my unwisdom in not having taken his advice  to go on foot.
