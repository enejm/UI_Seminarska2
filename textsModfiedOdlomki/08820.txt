 taught her how to use a rifle.    I called to him to send her away, but again she would not go, even after  a bullet had pierced her dress.    Still, all our shooting could not stop that rush of men, made desperate  by the fear of a fiery death. Leaving many stretched out behind them,  the first of the Arabs drew near to the south gate.    “My father,” said Mavovo in my ear, “now the real fighting is going to  begin. The gate will soon be down. _We_ must be the gate.”    I nodded, for if the Arabs once got through, there were enough of them  left to wipe us out five times over.
