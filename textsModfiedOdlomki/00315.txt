I was a real rabbit, as nature made me--wild and free!--and I even  enjoyed listening to the startled throbbing of my own heart!"    "I've often thought," said Dorothy, who was busily eating, "that it  would be fun to be a rabbit."    "It IS fun--when you're the genuine article," agreed his Majesty.  "But  look at me now!  I live in a marble palace instead of a hole in the  ground.  I have all I want to eat, without the joy of hunting for it.  Every day I must dress in fine clothes and wear that horrible crown  till it makes my head ache.  Rabbits come to me with all sorts of  troubles, when my own troubles are the only ones I care about.  When I  walk out I can't hop and run; I must strut on my rear legs and wear an  ermine robe!  And the soldiers salute me and the band plays and the  other rabbits laugh and clap their paws and cry out: 'Hail to the  King!'  Now let me ask you, as a friend and a young lady of good  judgment: isn't all this pomp and foolishness enough to make a decent  rabbit miserable?"    "Once," said Dorothy, reflectively, "men were wild and unclothed and  lived in caves and hunted for food as wild beasts do.  But they got  civ'lized, in time, and now they'd hate to go back to the old days."    "That is an entirely different case," replied the King.  "None of you  Humans were civilized in one lifetime.  It came to you by degrees.  But  I have known the forest and the free life, and that is why I resent  being civilized all at once, against my will, and being made a King  with a crown and an ermine robe.  Pah!"    "If you don't like it, why don't you resign?" she asked.    "Impossible!" wailed the Rabbit, wiping his eyes again with his  handkerchief.  "There's a beastly law in this town that forbids it.  When one is elected a King, there's no getting out of it."    "Who made the laws?" inquired Dorothy.
