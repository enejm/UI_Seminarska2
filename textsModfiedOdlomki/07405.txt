With an angry, warning roar he sprang forward to chase them from their  kill.  Sheeta bounded into a near-by thicket, while Tarzan took to the  low branches of an overhanging tree.    Here the ape-man unloosed his grass rope from about his neck, and as  Numa stood above the body of the boar, challenging head erect, he  dropped the sinuous noose about the maned neck, drawing the stout  strands taut with a sudden jerk.   At the same time he called shrilly  to Sheeta, as he drew the struggling lion upward until only his hind  feet touched the ground.    Quickly he made the rope fast to a stout branch, and as the panther, in  answer to his summons, leaped into sight, Tarzan dropped to the earth  beside the struggling and infuriated Numa, and with a long sharp knife  sprang upon him at one side even as Sheeta did upon the other.    The panther tore and rent Numa upon the right, while the ape-man struck  home with his stone knife upon the other, so that before the mighty  clawing of the king of beasts had succeeded in parting the rope he hung  quite dead and harmless in the noose.    And then upon the jungle air there rose in unison from two savage  throats the victory cry of the bull-ape and the panther, blended into  one frightful and uncanny scream.
