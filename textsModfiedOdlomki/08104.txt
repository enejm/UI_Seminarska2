   “Yes; poor Moliere!” said Loret, smiling; “he loves his home.”    “‘_He_ loves,’ yes,” replied Moliere, with his sad, sweet smile. “‘He  loves,’ that does not mean, they love _him_.”    “As for me,” said La Fontaine, “they love me at Chateau Thierry, I am  very sure.”    Aramis here re-entered after a brief disappearance.    “Will any one go with me?” he asked. “I am going by Paris, after having  passed a quarter of an hour with M.

Aramis perceived that the superintendent  either doubted him, or felt he was powerless to obtain the money. How  could Fouquet suppose that a poor bishop, ex-abbe, ex-musketeer, could  find any?    “Why doubt me?” said Aramis. Fouquet smiled and shook his head.    “Man of little faith!” added the bishop.    “My dear M. d’Herblay,” answered Fouquet, “if I fall--”
