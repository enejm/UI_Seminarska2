feebly out a few feet toward us and then stopped. We dropped the ship a  few feet but the amoeba did not follow. Jim glanced at the altimeter.    "Just as I thought," he exclaimed. "We are about forty-five miles above  the earth and already the air is so dense that the thing cannot move  lower. They are fashioned for existence in the regions of space and in  even the most rarified air they are helpless. There is no chance of one  ever reaching the surface of the earth without years of gradual  acclimation, and even if it did, it would be practically immobile. In a  few years the layer will flow enough to plug the hole I have made, but  even so, I'll build a couple of space flyers equipped with  disintegrating rays as soon as we get down and station them alongside  the hole to wipe out any of that space vermin which tries to come  through. Let's go home. We've put in a good day's work."    Hundreds of the purple amoeba have been destroyed by the guarding ships  during the past five years. The hole is filling in as Jim predicted, and  in another ten years the earth will be as securely walled in as it ever  was. But in the mean time, no one knows what unrevealed horrors space  holds, and the world will never rest entirely easy until the slow  process of time again heals the broken protective layer.    *       *       *       *       *    Everyone Is Invited    _To_ "_Come Over in_    'THE READERS' CORNER'"!    *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: _The men of Cleric were surrounding Jaska._]          Earth, the Marauder    BEGINNING A THREE-PART NOVEL    _By Arthur J.
