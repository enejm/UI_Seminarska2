"Silence!" growled Gugu the King, and Loo obeyed, although still  trembling with wrath.  The cold, steady gaze of the Leopard wandered  over the two strange beasts.  "The people of Oz," said he, "have not  been our friends; they have not been our enemies.  They have let us  alone, and we have let them alone.  There is no reason for war between  us.  They have no slaves.  They could not use us as slaves if they  should conquer us.  I think you are telling us lies, you strange  Li-Mon-Eag--you mixed-up beast who are neither one thing nor another."    "Oh, on my word, it's the truth!" protested the Nome in the beast's  shape.  "I wouldn't lie for the world; I--"    "Silence!" again growled Gugu the King; and somehow, even Ruggedo was  abashed and obeyed the edict.    "What do you say, Bru?" asked the King, turning to the great Bear, who  had until now said nothing.    "How does the Mixed Beast know that what he says is true?" asked the  Bear.    "Why, I can fly, you know, having the wings of an Eagle," explained the  Nome.  "I and my comrade yonder," turning to Kiki, "flew to a grove in  Oz, and there we heard the people telling how they will make many ropes  to snare you beasts, and then they will surround this forest, and all  other forests, and make you prisoners.  So we came here to warn you,  for being beasts ourselves, although we live in the sky, we are your  friends."    The Leopard's lip curled and showed his enormous teeth, sharp as  needles.  He turned to the Gray Ape.    "What do YOU think, Rango?" he asked.    "Send these mixed beasts away, Your Majesty," replied the Gray Ape.  "They are mischief-makers."    "Don't do that--don't do that!" cried the Unicorn, nervously.  "The  stranger said he would tell us what to do.  Let him tell us, then.  Are  we fools, not to heed a warning?"    Gugu the King turned to Ruggedo.    "Speak, Stranger," he commanded.
