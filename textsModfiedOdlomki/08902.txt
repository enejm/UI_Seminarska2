  I cried very much, and he took me downstairs, and after that I have only  a confused memory of men dressed in black carrying heavy burdens towards  the grey churchyard!    Next comes a vision of a great ship and wide tossing waters. My father  could no longer bear to live in England after the loss that had fallen  on him, and made up his mind to emigrate to South Africa. We must have  been poor at the time--indeed, I believe that a large portion of  our income went from my father on my motherâ€™s death.
