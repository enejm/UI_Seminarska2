An?  Where those wild men who had taken the princess from us?  Lastly,  but not least, where was I?    All the first stars of the Martian sky were strange to me, and my boat  whirling round and round on the current confused what little geography  I might otherwise have retained.  It was a cheerless look out, and  again and again I cursed my folly for coming on such a fool's errand as  I sat, chin in hand, staring at a landscape that grew more and more  depressing every mile.  To go on looked like destruction, to go back  was almost impossible without a guide; and while I was still wondering  which of the two might be the lesser evil, the stream I was on turned a  corner, and in a moment we were upon water which ran with swift, oily  smoothness straight for the snow-ranges now beginning to loom  unpleasantly close ahead.    By this time the night was coming on apace, the last of the  evil-looking birds had winged its way across the red sunset glare, and  though it was clear enough in mid-river under the banks, now steep and  unclimbable, it was already evening.    And with the darkness came a wondrous cold breath from off the  ice-fields, blowing through my lowland wrappings as though they were  but tissue. I munched a bit of honey-cake, took a cautious sip of wine,  and though I will not own I was frightened, yet no one will deny that  the circumstances were discouraging.    Standing up in the frail canoe and looking around, at the second glance  an object caught my eye coming with the stream, and rapidly overtaking  me on a strong sluice of water.  It was a raft of some sort, and  something extra-ordinarily like a sitting Martian on it!  Nearer and  nearer it came, bobbing to the rise and fall of each wavelet with the  last icy sunlight touching it up with reds and golds, nearer and nearer  in the deadly hush of that forsaken region, and then at last so near it  showed quite plainly on the purple water, a raft with some one sitting  under a canopy.
