away under a light west wind over the far plains, so that they were  seen through a haze of opal.    Laputa bade me take the lead.  I saw quite clear the red kloof on the  far side, where the collar was hid.  To get there we might have ridden  straight into the cup, but a providential instinct made me circle round  the top till we were on the lip of the ravine.  This was the road some  of Machudi's men had taken, and unthinkingly I followed them.  Twenty  minutes' riding brought us to the place, and all the while I had no  kind of plan of escape.  I was in the hands of my Maker, watching, like  the Jews of old, for a sign.    Laputa dismounted and looked down into the gorge.    'There is no road there,' I said.  'We must go down to the foot and  come up the stream-side.  It would be better to leave your horse here.'  He started down the cliff, which from above looks a sheer precipice.  Then he seemed to agree with me, took the rope from the _schimmel_'s  neck, and knee-haltered his beast.  And at that moment I had an  inspiration.    With my wrist-rope in his hand, he preceded me down the hill till we  got to the red screes at the foot of the kloof.  Then, under my  guidance, we turned up into the darkness of the gorge.  As we entered I  looked back, and saw figures coming over the edge of the green  cup--Laputa's men, I guessed. What I had to do must be done quickly.    We climbed up the burn, over the succession of little cataracts, till  we came to the flat space of shingle and the long pool where I had been  taken that morning.  The ashes of the fire which Machudi's men had made  were plain on the rock. After that I had to climb a waterfall to get to  the rocky pool where I had bestowed the rubies.    'You must take off this thong,' I said.  'I must climb to get the  collar.  Cover me with a pistol if you like.  I won't be out of sight.'
