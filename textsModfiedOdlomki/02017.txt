  The tight little cabin began to reek of the tobacco. Paula pressed  close to Bell.    "But--Charles," she asked hopefully, "is--is it really all right,  now?"    "I think so," said Bell, frowning. "Our job's over, anyhow. We go up  the Chilean coast and find that navy boat. We turn our stuff over to  them. They'll take over the task of seeing that every doctor,  everywhere in South America, knows how to get The Master's poison out  of the system of anybody who's affected. Some of them won't be  reached, but most of them will. I looked at his formula. Standard  drugs, all of them. There won't be any trouble getting the news  spread.

When did this  remarkably original idea occur to you?"    He puffed a huge cloud of smoke from his cigar. It was an unusually  vile cigar.
