sullenly hostile.    We came to an open cart. It stood by the roadside. An ox with shaggy  coat and spreading horns was fastened to the fence. It was a small cart  with small rollers like wheels. Seats were in it and a vivid canopy over  it. We climbed in and rumbled away.    *       *       *       *       *    And this starlit road in our own world was Broadway! We were presently  passing close to the river's edge. This quiet, peaceful, starlit river!  Why, in our world it was massed with docks! Great ocean liners, huge  funneled, with storied decks lay here! Under this river, tunnels with  endless passing vehicles! Tubes, with speeding trains crowded with  people!    The reality here was so different! Behind us what seemed an upper city  was strung along the river. Ahead of us also there were streets and  houses, the city of the workers. A bell was tolling. Along all the roads  now we could see the moving yellow spots of lights on the holiday carts  headed for the festival. And there were spots of yellow torchlight from  boats on the river.    We soon were entering the city streets. Narrow dirt streets they were,  with primitive shacks to the sides. Women came to the doorways to stare  at our little cart rumbling hastily past. I was conscious of my crimson  cloak, and conscious of the sullen glances of hate which were flung at  it from every side, here in this squalid, forlorn section where the  workers lived.    Along every street now the carts were passing, converging to the south.  They were filled, most of them, with young men and girls, all in gaudy  costumes. Some of them, like ourselves, were shrouded in crimson cloaks.  The carts occasionally were piled with flowers. As one larger than us,  and moving faster rumbled by, a girl in it stood up and pelted me with  blossoms. She wore a crimson robe, but it had fallen from her shoulders.
