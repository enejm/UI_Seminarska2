  In a day or so, of course, we'd have the one-man beetles and crewboats  out, and the floodlights orbiting overhead, and Vesta would be as  exposed to us as a molecule on a microscreen. Then work would start in  earnest. But in the meantime--and as usual--Hargraves, Reiss and I were  out prowling, our weighted boots clomping along in darkness. Captain  Feldman had long ago given up trying to keep his science-minded charges  from galloping off alone like this. In spite of being a military man,  Feld's a nice guy; he just shrugs and says, "Scientists!" when we appear  brightly at the airlock, waiting to be let out.    *       *       *       *       *    So the three of us went our separate ways, and soon were out of sight of  one another. Ed Reiss, the biologist, was looking hardest for animate  life, naturally.    But I found it.    *       *       *       *       *    I had crossed a long, rounded expanse of rock--lava, wonderfully  colored--and was descending into a boulder-cluttered pocket. I was  nearing the "bottom" of the chunk, the part that had been the deepest  beneath Sorn's surface before the blow-up. It was the likeliest place to  look for fossils.    But instead of looking for fossils, my eyes kept rising to those  incredible stars. You get that way particularly after several weeks of  living in steel; and it was lucky that I got that way this time, or I  might have missed the Zen.    My feet tangled with a rock. I started a slow, light-gravity fall, and  looked down to catch my balance. My torch beam flickered across a small,  red-furred teddy-bear shape. The light passed on. I brought it sharply  back to target.    My hair did _not_ stand on end, regardless of what you've heard me
