polar bear.    "Get up!" he shouted. "Quick! To the sun-ship!"    He seized Athalia and jerked her to her feet. She looked at him sleepily  for a moment, and then threw herself at him and hugged him frantically.    "You're not dead?"    Taking each by the arm, he half dragged them to the sun-ship, which had  landed only a few feet away. In a few minutes he had hot brandy for  them.    While they sipped greedily, he talked, between working the sun-ship's  controls.    "No, I wouldn't say it was a lucky moment that drew me to the sun-ship.  When I saw Eve trying to charm John, I had what you American slangists  call a hunch, which sent me to the sun-ship to get it off the ground so  that Adam couldn't commandeer it. And what is a hunch but a mental  penetration into the Fourth Dimension?" For a long moment, he brooded,  absent-minded. "I was in the air when the black ray, which I suppose is  Adam's deviltry, began to destroy everything it touched. From a safe  elevation I saw it wreck all my work." A sudden spasm crossed his face.  "I've flown over the entire valley. We're the only survivors--thank  God!"    "And so at last you confess that it is not well to tamper with human  life?" Northwood, warmed with hot brandy, was his old self again.    "Oh, I have not altogether wasted my efforts. I went to elaborate pains  to bring together a perfect man and a perfect woman of what Adam called  our Black Age." He smiled at them whimsically.    "And who can say to what extent you have thus furthered natural  evolution?" Northwood slipped his arm around Athalia. "Our children  might be more than geniuses, Doctor!"    Dr. Mundson nodded his huge, shaggy head gravely.    "The true instinct of a Creature of the Light," he declared.    *       *       *       *       *
