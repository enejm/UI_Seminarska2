'Not to be friends with him,' I said, 'but to bust him and all his  kind.'    'Then I'm ready,' said Peter cheerfully.  'What is it?'    I spread out the maps on the divan.  There was no light in the place  but Blenkiron's electric torch, for Hussin had put out the lantern.  Peter got his nose into the things at once, for his intelligence work  in the Boer War had made him handy with maps.
