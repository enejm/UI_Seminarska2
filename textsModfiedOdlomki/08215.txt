me and what I sought.    The sides of this well are not moist, green, or clammy, like the sides of  some others where damp and noxious exhalations abound, but dry and clean;  for it is said that there are below hidden entrances and exits for the  water, which keep it always moving. So these bricks were also dry and  clean, and this mark as sharp as if made yesterday, though the issue  showed that 'twas put there a very long time ago. Now the mark was not  deeply or regularly graven, but roughly scratched, as I have known boys  score their names, or alphabet letters, or a date, on the alabaster  figures that lie in Moonfleet Church. And here, too, was scored a letter  of the alphabet, a plain 'Y', and would have passed for nothing more  perhaps to any not born in Moonfleet; but to me it was the _cross-pall,_  or black 'Y' of the Mohunes, under whose shadow we were all brought up.

They understood what I would be  at, and slipped a noose over the well-rope and so drew it in to the side,  and made it fast till I should give the word to loose again. Thus I was  brought close to the well-wall, and the marked brick near about the level
