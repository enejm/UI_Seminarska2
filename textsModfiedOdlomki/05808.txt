  *       *       *       *       *    And then blank astonishment sank home in me--astonishment at the last  two words of her remark. I was already familiar with the Zens' enormous  intelligence, knowing Yurt as I did ... but imagine thinking to qualify  _years_ with _my_ when just out of nowhere a visitor from another  planetary orbit pops up! And there had been no special stress given the  distinction, just clear, precise thinking, like Yurt's.    I added, still a little awed: "We know how long ago your world died."    "I was child then," she said, "I don't know--what happened. I have  wondered." She looked up at my steel-and-glass face; I must have seemed  like a giant. Well, I suppose I was. "This--what we are on--was part of  Sorn, I know. Was it--" She fumbled for a word--"was it atom explosion?"    I told her how Sorn had gotten careless with its hydrogen atoms and had  blown itself over half of creation. (This the E.T.I. Teams had surmised  from scientific records found on Eros, as well as from geophysical  evidence scattered throughout the other bodies.)    "I was child," she said again after a moment. "But I remember--I  remember things _different_ from this. Air ... heat ... light ... how do  I live here?"    Again I felt amazement at its intelligence; (and it suddenly occurred to  me that astronomy and nuclear physics must have been taught in Sorn's  "elementary schools"--else that _my years_ and _atom explosion_ would  have been all but impossible). And now this old, old creature,  remembering back three thousand years to childhood--probably to those  "elementary schools"--remembering, and defining the differences in  environment between _then_ and _now_; and more, wondering at its  existence in the different _now_--    And then I got my own thinking straightened out. I recalled some of the  things we had learned about the Zen.    Their average lifespan had been 12,000 years or a little over. So the  Zen before me was, by our standards, about twenty-five years old.
