which I had seen him on my return from the East. Here he bade me enter,  and Bes to wait without. I went in and found two men and a woman in the  chamber, all standing very silent. The men were Pharaoh who still wore  his glorious robe and Double Crown, and the high priest of Isis clothed  in white; the other was the lady Amada also clothed in the snowy robes  of Isis.    At the sight of her thus arrayed my heart stopped and I stood silent  because I could not speak. She too stood silent and I saw that beneath  her thin veil her beautiful face was set and pale as that of an  alabaster statue. Indeed she might have been not a lovely living woman,  but the goddess Isis herself whose symbols she bore about her.    “Shabaka,” said Pharaoh at length, “the Royal Lady of Egypt, Amada,  priestess of Isis, has somewhat to say to you.”    “Let the Royal Lady of Egypt speak on to her servant and affianced  husband,” I answered.    “Count Shabaka, General of the armies,” she began in a cold clear voice  like to that of one who repeats a lesson, “learn that you are no more my  affianced husband and that I who am gathered again to Isis the divine,  am no more your affianced wife.”    “I do not understand. Will it please you to be more plain?” I said  faintly.    “I will be more plain, Count Shabaka, more plain than you have been with  me. Since we speak together for the last time it is well that I should  be plain. Hear me. When first you returned from the East, in yonder hall  you told us of certain things that happened to you there. Then the dwarf  your servant took up the tale. He said that he gave my name to the Great  King. I was wroth as well I might be, but even when I prayed that he  should be scourged, you did not deny that it was he who gave my name to  the King, although Pharaoh yonder said that if you had spoken the name  it would have been another matter.”
