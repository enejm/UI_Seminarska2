least a drier bed than this of mine, and at that thought, turning over,  I found all my muscles as stiff as iron, the sinews of my neck and  forearms a mass of agonies and no more fit to swim me to those reedy  swamps, which now, as pain and hunger began to tell, seemed to wear the  aspects of paradise.    With a groan I dropped back upon my raft and watched the islands  slipping by, while over my feet the southern sky darkened to purple.  There was no help there, but glancing round away on the left and a few  furlongs from me, I noticed on the surface of the water two converging  strands of brightness, an angle the point of which seemed to be coming  towards me.  Nearer it came and nearer, right across my road, until I  could see a black dot at the point, a head presently developed, then as  we approached the ears and antlers of a swimming stag.
