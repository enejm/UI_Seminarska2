Macumazahn."    "Indeed, Goza, and is your errand to cut my throat?"    "Not at present, Macumazahn, that is, unless you refuse to do  what the king wishes."    "And what does the king wish, Goza?"    "He wishes, Macumazahn, that you, his friend, should visit him."    "Which is just what I was on my way to do, Goza."
