  "Congratulations!" cried the neighbors. Pater and Mater bowed this way  and that in acknowledgment. Mater waved a condescending tentacle to the  three maiden aunts.    "I told you so!" said Pater triumphantly.    "Yes, dear...." said Mater meekly.    Suddenly there were outcries of alarm from the dwellers down-reef. A  wave of dismay swept audibly through all the nearer part of the colony.  Pater and Mater looked around, and froze.    Junior had begun paddling again, but this time in a most peculiar  manner--with a rotary twist and sidewise scoop which looked awkward,  but which he performed so deftly that he must have practiced it. Fixed  upright as he was now on the platform he had built, he looked for all  the world as if he were trying to swim sidewise.    "He's gone _mad_!" squeaked Mater.    "I ..." gulped Pater, "I'm afraid not."    At least, they saw, there was method in Junior's actions. He went on  paddling in the same fashion and now he, and his platform with him,  were farther away than they had been, and growing more remote as they  stared.    *       *       *       *       *    Parts of the homesite that was not a homesite revolved in some way  incomprehensible to eyes that had never seen the like. And the whole  affair trundled along, rocking at bumps in the sandy bottom, and  squeaking painfully; nevertheless, it moved.    The polyps watching from the reef swam out and frolicked after Junior,  watching his contrivance go and chattering eager questions, while their  parents bawled at them to keep away from that.    The three maiden aunts shrieked faintly and swooned in one another's  tentacles. The colony was shaken as it had not been since the tidal  wave.    "COME BACK!" thundered Pater. "You CAN'T do that!"    "_Come back!_" shrilled Mater. "You can't do _that_!"    "Come back!" gabbled the neighbors. "You can't _do_ that!"
