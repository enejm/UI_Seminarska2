He had jimp said the word, when Tod Lapraik cam to himsel’.    “Is this you, Tam?” says he.  “Haith, man!  I’m blythe to see ye.  I  whiles fa’ into a bit dwam like this,” he says; “its frae the stamach.”    Weel, they began to crack about the Bass and which of them twa was to get  the warding o’t, and little by little cam to very ill words, and twined  in anger.  I mind weel that as my faither and me gaed hame again, he cam  ower and ower the same expression, how little he likit Tod Lapraik and  his dwams.    “Dwam!” says he.  “I think folk hae brunt for dwams like yon.”    Aweel, my faither got the Bass and Tod had to go wantin’.  It was  remembered sinsyne what way he had ta’en the thing.  “Tam,” says he, “ye  hae gotten the better o’ me aince mair, and I hope,” says he, “ye’ll find  at least a’ that ye expeckit at the Bass.”  Which have since been thought  remarkable expressions.  At last the time came for Tam Dale to take young  solans.  This was a business he was weel used wi’, he had been a  craigsman frae a laddie, and trustit nane but himsel’.  So there was he  hingin’ by a line an’ speldering on the craig face, whaur its hieest and  steighest.  Fower tenty lads were on the tap, hauldin’ the line and  mindin’ for his signals.  But whaur Tam hung there was naething but the  craig, and the sea belaw, and the solans skirlin and flying.  It was a  braw spring morn, and Tam whustled as he claught in the young geese.  Mony’s the time I’ve heard him tell of this experience, and aye the swat  ran upon the man.    It chanced, ye see, that Tam keeked up, and he was awaur of a muckle  solan, and the solan pyking at the line.  He thocht this by-ordinar and  outside the creature’s habits.  He minded that ropes was unco saft  things, and the solan’s neb and the Bass Rock unco hard, and that twa  hunner feet were raither mair than he would care to fa’.
