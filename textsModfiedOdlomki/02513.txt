safe so far. And I've seen one of the weapons of the Ragged Men in  use. If we can get a couple of automatics and some cartridges to  Denham, he'll be safe until we can repair the big solenoid."    "There was the small catapult," said Von Holtz bitterly, "but it was  dismantled. The Herr Professor saw me examining it, and he dismantled  it. So that I did not learn how to calculate the way of changing the  position--"    *       *       *       *       *    Tommy's eyes rested queerly on Von Holtz for a moment.    "You know how to make the metal required," he said suddenly. "You'd  better get busy making it. Plenty of it. We'll need it."    Von Holtz stared at him, his weak eyes almost frightened.    "You _know_? You know how to combine the right angles?"    "I think so," said Tommy. "I've got to find out if I'm right. Will you  make the metal?"    Von Holtz bit at his too-red lips.    "But Herr Reames!" he said stridently, "I wish to know the equation!  Tell me the method of pointing a body in a fourth or a fifth  direction. It is only fair--"    "Denham didn't tell you," said Tommy.    Von Holtz's arms jerked wildly.    "But I will not make the metal! I insist upon being told the equation!  I insist upon it! I will not make the metal if you do not tell me!"    Smithers was in the laboratory, of course. He had been surveying the  big solenoid-catapult and scratching his chin reflectively. Now he  turned.    *       *       *       *       *    But Tommy took Von Holtz by the shoulders. And Tommy's hands were the  firm and sinewy hands of a sportsman, if his brain did happen to be
