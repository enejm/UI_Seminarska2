There still remained an  infinite number of possible changes of speed by manipulation of ovidum  by vibration set up by the Beryls, without which this flight from the  beginning would have been impossible. But for two hours, while the  white robed men of Cleric fought against the car of the crimson  splashes to prevent the capture of the daughter of their  Spokesman--and died by hundreds in the grip of those grim  tentacles--Sarka was forced to labor with the Beryls until  perspiration bathed his whole body and his heart was heavy as he  foresaw failure.
