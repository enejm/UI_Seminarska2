danger into which we were passing--had passed. We were in the midst of  a veritable swarm of meteorites of all sizes.    They were not large; I believe the largest I saw had a mass of not  more than three or four times that of the _Ertak_ herself. Some of the  smaller bodies were only fifty or sixty feet in diameter.    They were jagged and irregular in shape, and they seemed to spin at  varying speeds, like tiny worlds.    As I watched, fixing my view now on the space directly in our path, I  saw that our disintegrator ray men were at work. Deep in the bowels of  the _Ertak_, the moan of the ray generators had deepened in note; I  could even feel the slight vibration beneath my feet.    One of the meteorites slowly crumbled on top, the dust of  disintegration hovering in a compact mass about the body. More and  more of it melted away. The spinning motion grew irregular, eccentric,  as the center of gravity was changed by the action of the ray.    Another ray, two more, centered on the wobbling mass. It was directly  in our path, looming up larger and larger every second.    Faster and faster it melted, the rays eating into it from four sides.  But it was perilously near now; I had to reduce power in order to keep  all of it within the field of my disc. If--    The thing vanished before the very nose of the ship, not an instant  too soon. I glanced up at the surface temperature indicator, and saw  the big black hand move slowly for a degree or two, and stop. It was a  very sensitive instrument, and registered even the slight friction of  our passage through the disintegrated dust of the meteorite.    *       *       *       *       *    Our rays were working desperately, but disintegrator rays are not  nearly so effective in space as in an atmosphere of some kind.
