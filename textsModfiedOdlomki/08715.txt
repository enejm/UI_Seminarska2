about fifty yards away.    “Leave him to me,” shouted Umslopogaas. “Steel cuts where bullets cannot  pierce,” and with a bound like to that of a buck, the great Zulu leapt  away after him.    I think that Rezu meant to enter the hut for some purpose of his own,  but Umslopogaas was too hard upon his tracks. At any rate he ran past it  and down the other slope of the little hill on to the plain behind where  the remnants of his army were trying to re-form.
