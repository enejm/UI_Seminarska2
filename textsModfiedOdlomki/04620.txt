 "And after that?"    Broderick smiled gently. "Zur will grow. Our people will intermarry  with yours. The future population of Zur will be neither true Zurians  nor true Earthmen, but a mixture of both."    Zotul sat in silent thought. "But you did not have to buy us out. You  had the power to conquer us, even to destroy us. The whole planet could  have been yours alone." He stopped in alarm. "Or am I suggesting an  idea that didn't occur to you?"    "No," said Broderick, his usually smiling face almost pained with  memory. "We know the history of conquest all too well. Our method  causes more distress than we like to inflict, but it's better--and more  sure--than war and invasion by force. Now that the unpleasant job is  finished, we can repair the dislocations."    "At last I understand what you said about the tortoise."    "Slow but sure."

That's why we had  to break down your caste system."    Zotul's eyes widened. "And that is why my brothers did not beat me when  I failed!"    "Of course.
