 brass agrees that something is going on in inner space not according to  Hoyle or Euclid or anybody else and that we three characters might just  hit on something of scientific value.    The Magnificent Mole is built mostly of titanium, a metal which is only  about half as heavy as steel and twice as rugged. It is not quite as big  in diameter as the auger, for if it was any Martian moron knows we would  scrape our sides away before we got down three miles. We store  concentrated chow to last six months and get the acceleration couches  ready. We are to blast down at eighteen point oh-four hours, Friday, May  26th, 2022. Today is Wednesday. The big space brass, the fourteenth  estate haunt the spot marked X.    We get it both barrels from the jokers carrying press cards. They call  it Operation Upside Down. At last three characters were really going to  dig a hole and pull it in after them. Three hours before Dig-day, Exmud  R. Zmorro interviews us. We are televised around the orbit.    "Laying all joking aside, Spink," the news analyst says dolefully, "you  don't expect this to work."    "Of courst!" I says emphatically. "You forget the first man to reach New  Mu was a Spink. A Spink helped Columbus wade ashore in the West Indies.  The first man to invent a road-map all citizens could unfold and  understand was a Spink."    Zmorro turns to Zahooli and Wurpz. "Don't ask us anythin'!" they yelp in  unison. "You would only git a silly answer."    "A world inside of a world you said once, Spink. Ha--"    "Is that impossible? You have seen those ancient sailing ships built  inside of a bottle, Mr. Zmorro," I says.    He paws at his dome and takes a hyperbenzadrine tablet. "Well, thank  you, Septimus Spink. And have a good trip."    It is Friday. We climb up the ladder and into the Magnificent Mole.  "Check everything," I says to Wurpz. "You are the sub-strata  astrogator."    "Rogeria. I hope this worm can turn," Wurpz says.    *       *       *       *       *
