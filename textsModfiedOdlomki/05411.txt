don't come back right away, you guys seem to think the ship's haunted!  Haunted! By Betelguese! A sweet bunch of white-livered cowards I've  got for a crew--"    "Ah, lay off!" growled a deep, sullen voice. "I ain't scared, but this  looks fishy to me. Something's wrong down there 'tween the hulls--damn  wrong, I tell you. We only found four skeletons, an' four, ain't the  full crew for a ship like this. There oughta to be a couple more  somewhere. Carse, blast him! he's got nine lives. How do we know he  was one of the four?"    Another spoke up, as Rinker evidently hesitated. "I say we all go down  and investigate together."    "Stow it!" thundered Judd. "They didn't get their space-suits out, did  they? Why, they hadn't a chance to escape--none of 'em. They were  killed, every one, quick! And four's plenty to work this ship. Carse  is dead, see, dead! This was one trick he didn't know--one time he  couldn't worm out. He was clever, all right, but he couldn't quite  stack up against me. I swore I'd get him and I did. He's dead!"    "Judd," said a low, clear voice.    *       *       *       *       *    The Kite whirled around. He stared. The hand-flash he was holding  dropped to the deck with a clang. His hands went limp, and his voice  was suddenly weak and dazed.    "My God--Carse! Hawk Carse!"    "Yes," a whisper answered. "Hawk Carse. And not dead."    It was a scene that might have puzzled a newcomer to the frontiers of  space. Certainly there seemed to be nothing menacing about the slender  figure that stood by the now open man-hole, both arms hanging easily  at his sides; the advantage, on the contrary, appeared to be all with  the men whom he confronted. All but one was big, and each was fully  armed with a brace of ray-guns and knives.    But, though there were four guns to one, they made no attempt to draw.
