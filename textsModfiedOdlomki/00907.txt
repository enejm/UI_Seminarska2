worth the value of these castles and lands and other things which you  gave up because of me, so that it will be necessary to make up the  difference, dear, by loving you very much."    And at that he touched her chin, gently and masterfully, for Graciosa  would have averted her face, and it seemed to Eglamore that he could  never have his fill of gazing on the radiant, shamed tenderness of  Graciosa's face.  "Oh, my girl!" he whispered.  "Oh, my wonderful,  worshiped, merry girl, whom God has fashioned with such loving care!  you who had only scorn to give me when I was a kingdom's master! and  would you go with me now that I am friendless and homeless?"    "But I shall always have a friend," she answered--"a friend who showed  me what Balthazar's daughter was and what love is.  And I am vain  enough to believe I shall not ever be very far from home so long as I  am near to my friend's heart."    A mortal man could not but take her in his arms.    "Farewell, Duke Alessandro!" then said Eglamore; "farewell, poor clay  so plastic the least touch remodels you!  I had a part in shaping you  so bestial; our age, too, had a part--our bright and cruel day, wherein  you were set too high.  Yet for me it would perhaps have proved as easy  to have made a learned recluse of you, Alessandro, or a bloodless  saint, if to do that had been as patently profitable.  For you and all  your kind are so much putty in the hands of circumspect fellows such as  I.  But I stood by and let our poisoned age conform that putty into the  shape of a crazed beast, because it took that form as readily as any  other, and in taking it, best served my selfish ends.  Now I must pay  for that sorry shaping, just as, I think, you too must pay some day.  And so, I cry farewell with loathing, but with compassion also!"    Then these two turned toward the hills, leaving Duke Alessandro where  he lay in the road, a very lamentable figure in much bloodied finery.
