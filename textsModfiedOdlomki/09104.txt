As I never like to interfere with true  piety, I did not venture to suggest that his spirit had deigned to make  use of my eight-bore in his interest.    “Having despatched this boy back to the camp to tell the bearers to come  and cut the buffalo up, I bethought me that I owed that rhinoceros a  grudge which I should love to repay. So without saying a word of what  was in my mind to Gobo, who was now more than ever convinced that Fate  walked about loose in Wambe’s country, I just followed on the brute’s  spoor.
