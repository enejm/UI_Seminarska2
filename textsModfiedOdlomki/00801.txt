Frank Baum    All rights reserved    Published, July, 1904            Author's Note    After the publication of "The Wonderful Wizard of OZ" I began to receive  letters from children, telling me of their pleasure in reading the story and  asking me to "write something more" about the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman.  At first I considered these little letters, frank and earnest though they  were, in the light of pretty compliments; but the letters continued to come  during succeeding months, and even years.    Finally I promised one little girl, who made a long journey to see me and  prefer her request,--and she is a "Dorothy," by the way--that when a  thousand little girls had written me a thousand little letters asking for  the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman I would write the book, Either little  Dorothy was a fairy in disguise, and waved her magic wand, or the success of  the stage production of "The Wizard of OZ" made new friends for the story,  For the thousand letters reached their destination long since--and many  more followed them.    And now, although pleading guilty to long delay, I have kept my promise in  this book.
