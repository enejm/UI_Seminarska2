  "I spent all Monday investigating _them_!"    "A fine way to make a dollar," she said. "What do you care who they  are?"    He gave her a knowing smile. "That's my fat-headed girl. Like to visit  me in a nice jail, wouldn't you? One with a prestige address, of course.  Let me tell you. They rented that shack, and the dump heap next to it  for a pretty fancy figure. Robert Reeger said they were going to do  printing in that shack. They paid in full for the two years rental, in  nice crisp hundred-dollar bills...."    "I get it! They were phony," she exulted.    "How can you be so stupid? I know. For you it's easy. Of course the  bills were genuine. But the printing business--what were they going to  print with, typewriters? Another thing. There's no business record I  could find on them; they're not listed. So how did they get a million  dollars, and Robert said more. 'Report here, no matter what the time.' I  don't get it. I drove them out. There was no garage, no car I could see,  and the place is miles from food. How do they live out there?"    "Maybe they have friends who pick them up," Deena said.    "Maybe. Robert also said there was a rumor or something about the  government going to use the area for a missile depot. I tried to run it  down. Nothing."    "Which proves nothing," she said.    "True. But I couldn't even smell smoke. No, the whole thing just smells  bad. So I think I'm going back there and tell them to forget it."    "Oh, don't be an idiot," she said. "This is your big chance to make some  real money, get a reputation, and because you're chicken, you're going  to throw it up."    "I won't get into anything crooked!" his voice rose.    "The way you're thinking you couldn't follow a straight line."    "They can't draw a straight line."    "Well, you do what you want. Only, the next time I have to pay for a  dinner don't give me that martyred look."
