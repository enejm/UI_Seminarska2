When he had been with us a year, a deputation came to him from the tribe  he had left, asking him to return. Things had not gone well with them  since he went away, they said, and now the chief, his enemy, was  dead. Old Indaba-zimbi listened to them till they had done, and, as he  listened, raked sand into a little heap with his toes. Then he spoke,  pointing to the little heap, “There is your tribe to-day,” he said.  Then he lifted his heel and stamped the heap flat. “There is your tribe  before three moons are gone. Nothing is left of it. You drove me away: I  will have no more to do with you; but when you are being killed think of  my words.”    The messengers went. Three months afterwards I heard that the whole  community had been wiped out by an Impi of raiding Pondos.    When I was at length ready to start upon my expedition, I went to old  Indaba-zimbi to say good-bye to him, and was rather surprised to find  him engaged in rolling up medicine, assegais, and other sundries in his  blankets.    “Good-bye, Indaba-zimbi,” I said, “I am going to trek north.”    “Yes, Macumazahn,” he answered, with his head on one side; “and so am  I--I want to see that country. We will go together.”    “Will we!” I said; “wait till you are asked, you old humbug.”    “You had better ask me, then, Macumazahn, for if you don’t you will  never come back alive. Now that the old chief (my father) is gone to  where the storms come from,” and he nodded to the sky, “I feel myself  getting into bad habits again. So last night I just threw up the bones  and worked out about your journey, and I can tell you this, that if you  don’t take me you will die, and, what is more, you will lose one who is  dearer to you than life in a strange fashion. So just because you gave  me that hint a couple of years ago, I made up my mind to come with you.”    “Don’t talk stuff to me,” I said.
