all her witchcraft, cannot hear one word we speak within the magic  circle I have made," replied Ozma. "We may now speak freely and as  loudly as we wish, without fear of the Queen's anger."    Lady Aurex brightened at this.    "Can I trust you?" she asked.    "Ev'rybody trusts Ozma," exclaimed Dorothy. "She is true and honest,  and your wicked Queen will be sorry she insulted the powerful Ruler of  all the Land of Oz."    "The Queen does not know me yet," said Ozma, "but I want you to know  me, Lady Aurex, and I want you to tell me why you, and all the  Skeezers, are unhappy. Do not fear Coo-ee-oh's anger, for she cannot  hear a word we say, I assure you."    Lady Aurex was thoughtful a moment; then she said: "I shall trust you,  Princess Ozma, for I believe you are what you say you are--our supreme  Ruler. If you knew the dreadful punishments our Queen inflicts upon us,  you would not wonder we are so unhappy. The Skeezers are not bad  people; they do not care to quarrel and fight, even with their enemies  the Flatheads; but they are so cowed and fearful of Coo-ee-oh that they  obey her slightest word, rather than suffer her anger."    "Hasn't she any heart, then?" asked Dorothy.    "She never displays mercy. She loves no one but herself," asserted Lady  Aurex, but she trembled as she said it, as if afraid even yet of her  terrible Queen.    "That's pretty bad," said Dorothy, shaking her head gravely. "I see  you've a lot to do here, Ozma, in this forsaken corner of the Land of  Oz. First place, you've got to take the magic away from Queen  Coo-ee-oh, and from that awful Su-dic, too. My idea is that neither of  them is fit to rule anybody, 'cause they're cruel and hateful. So  you'll have to give the Skeezers and Flatheads new rulers and teach all  their people that they're part of the Land of Oz and must obey, above  all, the lawful Ruler, Ozma of Oz. Then, when you've done that, we can  go back home again."
