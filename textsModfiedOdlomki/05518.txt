   "Carse, I've got you! You've seen our ray, of course, but have you  looked at your speed-indicator? You're caught--and this time you're  going to stay caught. You cannot possibly resist the magnetic ray I  have on you, and in a few minutes you will be drawn right into me. I  advise you to surrender peacefully. No tricks--though there's no trick  that could do you any good! Nothing! I have you this time!"    A frosty smile tightened the Hawk's lips.    "I was right, Eliot," he murmured. "The man behind the panel took the  asteroid to Lar Tantril. He is our opponent."    *       *       *       *       *    Those were his words, but he did nothing. He seemed content to stand  with cold, intent face looking back through the infra-red  electelscope. The _Sandra's_ speed sank to three hundred, two hundred  and soon a hundred, and the asteroid, which was of course also  decelerating, crept up remorselessly. Ban Wilson had every confidence  in the Hawk, but finally the inaction grew too much for him to bear.    "Jumping Jupiter, Carse!" he sputtered. "--aren't you going to do  anything? Use our rays! Try maneuvering to the side! Damn it, we're  just letting them take us!"    The adventurer might not have heard, for all the sign he gave. The  Earth-clock on the wall ticked on; seconds built minutes, and the  minutes passed. The asteroid was only ten miles astern.    "Eliot," said Carse quietly, "get me one of your infra-red glasses."    He took over the controls again. Carefully he varied the forward  repulsion and sent current to the side gravity-plates, and slowly the  _Sandra_ answered by rotating, longitudinally, reversing her position.  Still maintaining a slight and dwindling speed toward Earth, her bow  swung from that planet's eye-filling panorama and came to face,  instead, the invisible asteroid. When turned completely around, the  men in her control cabin looked through the bow windows right into  the brilliant cone of the purple ray.
