 from all its aspects and every angle, and was no nearer to peace of  mind when, at half-past ten to the second, Mr. Jackson Hyane returned.    But Bones had formed one definite conclusion, and had settled upon the  action he intended taking.  Mr. Hyane, entering the study, saw the  cheque book on the desk, and was cheered.  Bones had to clear his voice  several times before he could articulate.    "Mr. Hyane," he said huskily, "I have been thinking matters out.  I am  a great admirer of yours--of your--of yours--a tremendous admirer of  yours, Mr. Hyane.  Anything that made her happy, old Mr. Hyane, would  make me happy.  You see?"    "I see," said Mr. Hyane, and he had the satisfaction of knowing that  he, a student of men, had not misread his victim.    "Fourteen thousand pounds," said Bones, turning abruptly to the desk  and seizing his pen.  "Make it payable to you?"    "You're too kind," murmured Hyane.  "Make it an open cheque, Mr.  Tibbetts--I have to pay the agents in cash.  These Indian merchants are  so suspicious."    Bones wrote the cheque rapidly, marked it "Pay Cash," and initialled  the corrections, then tore the slip from the book and handed it to the  other.    "Of course, Mr. Tibbetts," said Hyane reverentially, "I regard half  this as a loan to me and half as a loan to my dear wife.  We shall  never forget your kindness."    "Rot!" said Bones.  "Nonsense!  I hope you'll be happy, and will you  tell her----"  He swallowed something.    There was a faint tinkle of a bell in the hall, and Ali, his servant,  poked an ebony face round the corner of the door.    "Sir," he said, "the telephonic apparatus demands conversation."    Bones was glad of the interruption, and, with a muttered apology to his  gratified guest, he strode out into the hall.  Ali had accustomed  himself to answering the telephone, but this time he had not understood  the preliminary inquiry from exchange.    "Hello!" said Bones into the transmitter.
