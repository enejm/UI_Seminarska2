 forget to give due credit to the Glass Cat and the little Wizard, but  it was really Cap'n Bill who had bravely carried the golden flower-pot  away from the enchanted Isle.    Ozma thanked them all, and said she would place the Magic Flower in her  boudoir where she might enjoy its beauty and fragrance continually.  But now she discovered the marvelous gown woven by Glinda and her  maidens from strands drawn from pure emeralds, and being a girl who  loved pretty clothes, Ozma's ecstasy at being presented with this  exquisite gown may well be imagined.

"Why, I'd almost forgotten them," was the reply; "but I believe they  are still here in my pocket."    Then he searched in his pockets and brought out the two nuts and showed  them to her.
