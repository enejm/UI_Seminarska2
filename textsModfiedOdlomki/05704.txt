  The funeral had taken place on the day fixed for the picnic. The latter,  in consideration of the saddened temper of the young people, was put off  a fortnight.          CHAPTER III.      About half-past eight on the morning of the day set for the postponed  picnic, Henry knocked at Widow Brand's door. He had by no means forgotten  Madeline's consent to allow him to carry her basket, although two weeks  had intervened.    She came to the door herself. He had never seen her in anything that set  off her dark eyes and olive complexion more richly than the simple picnic  dress of white, trimmed with a little crimson braid about the neck and  sleeves, which she wore to-day. It was gathered up at the bottom for  wandering in the woods, just enough to show the little boots. She looked  surprised at seeing him, and exclaimed--    "You haven't come to tell me that the picnic is put off again, or Laura's  sick?"    "The picnic is all right, and Laura too. I've come to carry your basket  for you."    "Why, you're really very kind," said she, as if she thought him slightly  officious.    "Don't you remember you told me I might do so?" he said, getting a little  red under her cool inspection.    "When did I?"    "Two weeks ago, that evening poor George spoke in meeting."    "Oh!" she answered, smiling, "so long ago as that? What a terrible memory  you have! Come in just a moment, please; I'm nearly ready."    Whether she merely took his word for it, or whether she had remembered  her promise perfectly well all the time, and only wanted to make him ask  twice for the favour, lest he should feel too presumptuous, I don't  pretend to know. Mrs. Brand set a chair for him with much cordiality. She  was a gentle, mild-mannered little lady, such a contrast in style and  character to Madeline that there was a certain amusing fitness in the  latter's habit of calling her "My baby."    "You have a very pleasant day for your picnic, Mr. Burr," said she.
