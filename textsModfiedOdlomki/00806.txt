 74    "What don't you understand?" asked the Scarecrow.    "Why, I don't understand your language. You see, I came from the Country of  the Gillikins, so that I am a foreigner."    "Ah, to be sure!" exclaimed the Scarecrow. "I myself speak the language of  the Munchkins, which is also the language of the Emerald City. But you, I  suppose, speak the language of the Pumpkinheads?"    "Exactly so, your Majesty" replied the other, bowing; "so it will be  impossible for us to understand one another."    "That is unfortunate, certainly," said the Scarecrow, thoughtfully. "We must  have an interpreter."    "What is an interpreter?" asked Jack.    "A person who understands both my language and your own. When I say  anything, the interpreter can tell you what I mean; and when you say  anything the interpreter can tell me what you mean. For the interpreter can  speak both languages as well as understand them."    "That is certainly clever," said Jack, greatly pleased at finding so simple  a way out of the difficulty.    So the Scarecrow commanded the Soldier with the Green Whiskers to search  among his people        75  until he found one who understood the language of the Gillikins as well as  the language of the Emerald City, and to bring that person to him at once.    When the Soldier had departed the Scarecrow said:    "Won't you take a chair while we are waiting?"    "Your Majesty forgets that I cannot understand you," replied the  Pumpkinhead. "If you wish me to sit down you must make a sign for me to do  so." The Scarecrow came down from his throne and rolled an armchair to a  position behind the Pumpkinhead. Then he gave Jack a sudden push that sent  him sprawling upon the cushions in so awkward a fashion that he doubled up  like a jackknife, and had hard work to untangle himself.    "Did you understand that sign?" asked His Majesty, politely.    "Perfectly," declared Jack, reaching up his arms to turn his head to the  front, the pumpkin having twisted around upon the stick that supported it.
