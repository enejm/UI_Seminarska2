stared, and saw that I must have been mistaken--it seemed closely shut.    With a succession of efforts, I trod my way to the window, and looked  out. The sun was just rising, lighting up the tangled wilderness of  gardens. For, perhaps, a minute, I stood, and stared. I passed my hand,  confusedly, across my forehead.    Presently, amid the chaos of my senses, a sudden thought came to me; I  turned, quickly, and called to Pepper. There was no answer, and I  stumbled across the room, in a quick access of fear.
