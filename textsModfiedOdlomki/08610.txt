“Mashune was, I think, one of the bravest men I ever knew in the  daytime, but he had a more than civilized dread of the supernatural.    “‘Must I go myself, thou fool?’ I said, sternly.    “‘Nay, Macumazahn, if thy heart yearns for strange things like a sick  woman, I go, even if the ghosts devour me.’    “And accordingly he went, and soon returned with a large bundle of  watercresses, of which I ate greedily.    “‘Art thou not hungry?’ I asked the great Zulu presently, as he sat  eyeing me eating.    “‘Never was I hungrier, my father.’    “‘Then eat,’ and I pointed to the watercresses.    “‘Nay, Macumazahn, I cannot eat those herbs.’    “‘If thou dost not eat thou wilt starve: eat, Mashune.’    “He stared at the watercresses doubtfully for a while, and at last  seized a handful and crammed them into his mouth, crying out as he did  so, ‘Oh, why was I born that I should live to feed on green weeds like  an ox? Surely if my mother could have known it she would have killed me  when I was born!’ and so he went on lamenting between each fistful of  watercresses till all were finished, when he declared that he was full  indeed of stuff, but it lay very cold on his stomach, ‘like snow upon  a mountain.’ At any other time I should have laughed, for it must be  admitted he had a ludicrous way of putting things. Zulus do not like  green food.    “Just after Mashune had finished his watercress, we heard the loud  ‘woof! woof!’ of a lion, who was evidently promenading much nearer to  our little skerm than was pleasant. Indeed, on looking into the darkness  and listening intently, I could hear his snoring breath, and catch the  light of his great yellow eyes. We shouted loudly, and Mashune threw  some sticks on the fire to frighten him, which apparently had the  desired effect, for we saw no more of him for a while.    “Just after we had had this fright from the lion, the moon rose in her  fullest splendour, throwing a robe of silver light over all the earth.
