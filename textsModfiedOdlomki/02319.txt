throat. That devil of a guard! Why hadn't he killed him? He dashed  through the passage, Ora at his heels.    Sure enough, the crippled guard had dragged himself to the controls;  was manipulating the energy director as he had seen Mado do. They were  heading directly for the terrible monster of the heavens!    No need now to peer through the telescope. The thing was visible to  the naked eye. No power could save them! Carr hurled himself at the  guard and tore at the hairy paw which gripped the lever. The throbbing  of strange energies filled the air of the room, and Carr's brain  pulsed with the maddening rhythm. The red discharge appeared at the  projections of the control panels. He forgot the fleet of the Llotta,  forgot the menace to his own world. Only Ora mattered now, and he had  not the power to save her!    As in a daze he knew he was wrenching mightily at the body of the  powerful minion of Rapaju. His fingers encountered heated metal--one  of the ray-pistols. He felt the intense vibration of the weapon as its  charge was released. But he still lived. The beast who held it had  missed! Dimly he was conscious of the screams of Ora; of the yielding  of the creature who fought him. An animal cry registered on his  consciousness and he shook the suddenly limp Llotta from him. He knew  somehow that his last enemy was gone.    A quick glance showed him that Ora was still on her feet, braced  against the wall. The red veil was before his eyes. He grasped the  controls, and fought desperately to keep his strength and senses. A  streamer of horrid whiteness swung across his vision; slithered  clammily over the glass of one of the forward ports. They were into  the thing! It was the end! He groaned aloud as he fumbled with the  mechanisms and strove to formulate a plan of escape.    *       *       *       *       *
