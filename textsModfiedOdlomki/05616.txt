 *       *       *       *       *    "Yes!" cried Lawson, the scientist. "But the explosion--it might  shatter the ship!"    "No matter; I expect it to!" answered Ken. "Then you can leave through  a crack instead of a port-lock."    "Yes--but you!" objected the captain. "Get on a suit!"    "No; I'm jumping into my torpoon in the other port-lock. I've got the  food in it. Now, Sallorsen, this is your job. I'll be in my torpoon,  but I won't be able to let myself out the port. You open it, right  after the explosion. Understand?"    "Yes," replied Sallorsen, and Lawson nodded.    "All right," gasped Ken Torrance. "Empty the chamber." As the captain  did so, Ken opened the lid of the biscuit can and adjusted the timing  device on the exposed unit in the clothing-wrapped bundle. Then he  replaced it, ticking, in the can and thrust the can bodily into the  emptied chamber of the port-lock. He closed the inner door of the  chamber, and said to the men by him:    "Close your face-plates!"    And Ken pushed the release button: and then he was running to the  other port-lock and to his torpoon, and harnessing himself in.    His brain teemed with the possibilities of the situation as he lay  stretched out in the torpoon, waiting. How much would the submarine be  smashed? Would the charge of nitromite, besides killing the sealmen,  kill everyone inside the _Peary_? For that matter, would it affect the  sealmen at all? How much could the creatures stand? And would the  firing mechanism work? And then would he himself be able to get out;  or would the lock in which the torpoon lay be damaged by the explosion  and trap him there?    Seconds, only seconds, to wait, small fractions of time--but they were  more important than the days and the weeks that the _Peary_ had lain,  a lashed-down captive, under the Arctic ice; for in these seconds was
