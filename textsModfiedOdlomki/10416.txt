had accompanied him on his journey.    "Lord," said S'kobi, "my fine soldiers do not go with you, for I have  seen how wise is Sandi who is my father and my mother."    Bosambo choked, and as was usual in moments of intense emotion, found  refuge in English.    "Dam' nigger!" he said wrathfully, "I bring um army, I feed um, I keep  um proper--you pinch um! Black t'ief! Pig! You bad feller! I speak you  bad for N'poloyani--him fine feller."    "Lord," said the uncomprehending king, "I see that you are like Sandi  for you speak his tongue. He also said 'Dam' very loudly. I think it is  the word white folk say when they are happy."    Bosambo met Bones hurrying to the scene of the fighting, and told his  tale.    "Lord," said he in conclusion, "what was I to do, for you told nothing  of the ways of N'poloyani when his army was stolen from him. Tell me  now, Tibbetti, what this man would have done."    But Bones shook his head severely.    "This I cannot tell you, Bosambo," he said, "for if I do you will tell  others, and my lord N'poloyani will never forgive me."          CHAPTER X    THE WATERS OF MADNESS      Unexpected things happen in the Territories which Mr. Commissioner  Sanders rules. As for example: Bones had gone down to the beach to "take  the mail." This usually meant no more than receiving a mail-bag wildly  flung from a dancing surf-boat. On this occasion Bones was surprised to  discover that the boat had beached and had landed, not only the mail,  but a stranger with his baggage.    He was a clean-shaven, plump man, in spotless white, and he greeted  Bones with a friendly nod. "Morning!" he said. "I've got your mail."    Bones extended his hand and took the bag without evidence of any  particular enthusiasm.    "Sanders about?" asked the stranger.    "Mr. Sanders is in residence, sir," said Bones, ponderously polite.    The other laughed. "Show the way," he said briskly.
