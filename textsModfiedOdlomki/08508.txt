Accordingly, having purchased a capital log canoe, large enough to hold  us all and our baggage, from the headman of the village we were staying  in, presenting him with three empty cold-drawn brass cartridges by way  of payment, with which he was perfectly delighted, we set out to make  a tour of the lake in order to find the most favourable place to make a  camp. As we did not know if we should return to this village, we put all  our gear into the canoe, and also a quarter of cooked water-buck, which  when young is delicious eating, and off we set, natives having already  gone before us in light canoes to warn the inhabitants of the other  villages of our approach.    As we were puddling leisurely along Good remarked upon the extraordinary  deep blue colour of the water, and said that he understood from the  natives, who were great fishermen--fish, indeed, being their principal  food--that the lake was supposed to be wonderfully deep, and to have  a hole at the bottom through which the water escaped and put out some  great fire that was raging below.    I pointed out to him that what he had heard was probably a legend  arising from a tradition among the people which dated back to the time  when one of the extinct parasitic volcanic cones was in activity. We saw  several round the borders of the lake which had no doubt been working  at a period long subsequent to the volcanic death of the central crater  which now formed the bed of the lake itself. When it finally became  extinct the people would imagine that the water from the lake had run  down and put out the big fire below, more especially as, though it was  constantly fed by streams running from the snow-tipped peaks about,  there was no visible exit to it.    The farther shore of the lake we found, on approaching it, to consist  of a vast perpendicular wall of rock, which held the water without any  intermediate sloping bank, as elsewhere. Accordingly we paddled parallel  with this precipice, at a distance of about a hundred paces from it,  shaping our course for the end of the lake, where we knew that there was
