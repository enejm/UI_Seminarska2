Almost I did so, but that cleft horn, to which hung the remains  of Umbezi’s moocha, scooped me up and hurled me off the river bank  backwards and sideways into the deep pool below. As I departed thither I  saw Saduko spring forward and heard a shot fired that caused the bull to  collapse for a moment. Then with a slow, sliding motion it followed me  into the pool.    Now we were together, and there was no room for both, so after a certain  amount of dodging I went under, as the lighter dog always does in a  fight.
