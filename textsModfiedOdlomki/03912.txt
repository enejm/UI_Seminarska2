Bonnie also sat and stared. "How much of that stuff do I have to drink?"    "Just a little bit. Stick one finger in it and lick it off."    Bonnie pointed a cautious finger at the tarry-looking brew and slowly  immersed it, until it barely covered the nail. "Is that enough?"    "Plenty," said Bob in a judicious tone.    Bonnie took her finger out of the pot and stared at it for a moment.  "What if I get sick?"    "You can't get sick. There's aspirin and vitamins in it, too."    Bonnie sighed and wrinkled her nose. "Well, here goes," she said. She  licked off a little bit.    Bob watched her with his television version of a scientific look. "How  do you feel?" he inquired.    Bonnie answered, "It's not so bad, once it goes down. You can taste the  chocolate graham cracker." Bonnie was really enjoying the attention.  "Hey," she said, "I'm starting to get a funny feeling in my--" and,  before she could finish the sentence, there was a loud _pop_.    Bob's face registered extreme disappointment.    She sat quite still for a moment and then said, "What happened?"    "You've turned into a chicken."    *       *       *       *       *    The little bird lifted its wings and looked down at itself. "How come  I'm a chicken, Bob?" it said, cocking its head to one side and staring  at him with its left eye.    "Ah, nuts," he explained. "I expected you to be more of a pigeon  thing." Bob mulled over the ingredients of his stew to see what went  wrong.    The chicken hopped around the chair on one leg, flapped its wings  experimentally and found itself on the kitchen table. It walked to the  far corner and peered into a small mirror that hung on the side of the  sink cabinet.    "I'm a pretty ugly chicken, boy," it said.
