  The Trans-Space leader raised his microphone.    Dan ripped it out of his hand and knocked him off his feet, then knelt  and picked up the heavy shield that had been taken off the statue to  get at the ring.    A bullet hummed over Dan's head.    With a rush of air and a heavy smash, the statue landed full length on  the ground. Dan hauled himself up onto its base. Another bullet buzzed  past him. Then there was a yell, and Dan looked down in the street.    The sweepers were horrible as they poured from their holes, but they  looked almost beautiful to Dan. He glanced at the Porcyns massed on the  steps, their faces white with near-hysteria. Their eyes were open and  watching him; the Trans-Space men were too busy to give orders.    Dan raised the microphone and his voice boomed out:    "_Close your eyes till you hear the roar of the lion! Then obey your  true leaders!_"    He repeated the order three times before it dawned on the Trans-Space  technicians that this was not according to plan. The loudspeaker gave  a booming click and cut off. By then, the sweepers had been killed and  Dan became aware of bullets thrumming past him. Suddenly he felt weak  with panic that the rest of the plan had fallen apart.    Up the street, Porcyn men were unscrewing a cap on the face of a  building. They connected a hose. A sky-blue-caped Trans-Space agent  ordered them away. The Porcyns turned, wads of wax in their ears, and  raised the hose.    A stream of water knocked the agents backward. Shots rang out. Porcyns  fell, but other Porcyns took their places. The stream arched and fell  on the Trans-Space agents and abruptly a whirl of color tinged the  water. Blots and blobs of green, orange, pink and yellow spattered the  blue-caped agents.    At the end of the street, someone ran up tugging a lion by the mane.    "_Go_, dog! _Run!_"    Somewhere a child cried out in terror.    The lion roared.    The troops on the steps opened their eyes.
