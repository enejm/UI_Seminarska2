 and spill it, the better it will be for you. Where did you hide it?"    "I didn't hide it!" cried the teller, his voice trembling. "Mr. Trier  can tell you that I didn't touch it from the time I laid it down until I  turned back."    "That's right," replied the paymaster. "He turned his back on me for a  moment, and when he turned back, it was gone."    "So you're in on it too, are you?" said Sturtevant.    "What do you mean?" demanded the paymaster hotly.    "Oh nothing, nothing at all," replied the detective. "Of course Winston  didn't touch it and it disappeared and you never saw it go, although you  were within three feet of it all the time. Did _you_ see anything?" he  demanded of the guard.    "Nothing that I am sure of," answered the guard. "I thought that a  shadow passed in front of me for an instant, but when I looked again, it  was gone."    *       *       *       *       *    Dr. Bird sat forward suddenly. "What did this shadow look like?" he  asked.    "It wasn't exactly a shadow," said the guard. "It was as if a person had  passed suddenly before me so quickly that I couldn't see him. I seemed  to feel that there was someone there, but I didn't rightly _see_  anything."    "Did you notice anything of the sort?" demanded the doctor of Trier.    "I don't know," replied Trier thoughtfully. "Now that Williams has  mentioned it, I did seem to feel a breath of air or a motion as though  something had passed in front of me. I didn't think of it at the time."    "Was this shadow opaque enough to even momentarily obscure your vision?"  went on the doctor.    "Not that I am conscious of. It was just a breath of air such as a  person might cause by passing very rapidly."    "What made you ask Trier if he had the money when you turned around?"
