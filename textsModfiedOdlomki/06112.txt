   "All right, let's use those minutes. I'm beginning to see this thing a  little clearer. Joan, what we've got here is a one-shot gamble; right?"    "In effect," she said cautiously.

They scrabbled for them for a year  and never pulled up a one; they finally had to warn the public that if  it found anything funny-looking along the shore it shouldn't bang said  object, or shake it either.
