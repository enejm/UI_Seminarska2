saw before me in a crook of the bay a smoking cottage. And, plodding  along by the water's edge, was the bent figure of a man, laden with  nets and lobster pots. Also, beached on the shingle was a boat.    I quickened my pace and overtook the fisherman. He was an old man with  a ragged grey beard, and his rig was seaman's boots and a much-darned  blue jersey. He was deaf, and did not hear me when I hailed him. When  he caught sight of me he never stopped, though he very solemnly  returned my good evening.

In highland places one sex ages  quicker than the other.    'This gentleman would like to bide the night. I wass telling him that  we had a poor small house, but he says he will not be minding it.'    She looked at me with the timid politeness that you find only in  outland places.
