  Marge frowned. "I suppose you could say that," she conceded. "He has the  garage full of stuff he's made or bought with the allowance his father  sends him. And if you come within ten feet of it without permission, you  get an electric shock right out of thin air. But that's only part of it.  It--" she gave a helpless gesture--"it's Elmer's effect on everybody.  Everybody over fifteen, that is. He sits there, a little, dark,  squinched-up kid wearing thick glasses and talking about how climatic  changes inside fifty years will flood half the world, cause the collapse  of civilization--"    "Wait a minute!" I cut in. "Scientists seem to think that's possible in  a few thousand years. Not fifty."    "Elmer says fifty," Marge stated flatly. "From the way he talks, I  suspect he's figured out a way to speed things up and is going to try it  some day just to see if it works. Meanwhile he fools around out there in  the garage, sneering about the billions of dollars spent to develop  color TV. He says his lens will turn any ordinary broadcast into color  for about twenty-five dollars. He says it's typical of the muddled  thinking of our so-called scientists--I'm quoting now--to do everything  backward and overlook fundamental principles."    "Bro-ther!" I said.    Doreen came trotting back in then, with her hat box. "I'm tired of that  game," she said, giving the TV set a bored glance. And as she said it  the tube went dark. The sound cut off.    "Damn!" I swore. "Must be a power failure!" I grabbed the phone and  jiggled the hook. No dice. The phone was dead, too.    "You're funny," Doreen giggled. "It's just the unhappy genii. See?"    She flicked over the catch on the hatbox.    And the picture came back on. The sound started up. "--swings and misses  for strike two!" The air conditioner began to hum.    Marge and I stared. Mouths open. Wide.    *       *       *       *       *
