help us?"    "What do you mean?"    The older man smiled, a little sadly. "Those brains--they once were  friends of mine. It's possible they'll answer our questions. It won't  hurt to try. We'll ask them how it might be possible to get out."    Hawk Carse cried: "Eliot, you've got it! There is a chance!"    But the negro shivered. The brains stood for magic, for ghosts--for  awful, unknown things he wanted nothing to do with.    Carse shoved back the screen concealing the infamous device.    "We know where this switch is, at least. If only the current's not been  turned off!"    "Probably not," the Master Scientist said, out of his own technical  thought-train.    Friday hung back, loath to be concerned. He looked askance at the thing,  his open mouth a small round circle.    The Hawk was at the switch, but his hand hesitated. In spite of the  emergency at the doors, in spite of his innate promptness of action, he  hesitated. This thing he was about to do--this awful human mechanism  before him--they were so weird and unnatural....    Then he heard a faint click inside the laboratory--in a place where no  one should be. Instinctively he whirled and crouched--and an orange ray  streaked over his head with its wicked spit of death. At once his own  ray-gun was up and answering to the spot where the other bolt had  started, and then he was flat on the floor and ceiling toward the wall  opposite.    *      *      *      *      *    A high wide panel in the wall had slid open, with only the faint noise  Carse had heard to mark its movement. For just a few seconds it stayed  open. The Hawk covered the last few feet in a desperate rush, but he  reached it too late. It clicked shut in his face, and there was no hold  for his hands when he tried to force it back.
