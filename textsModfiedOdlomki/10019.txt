"Ass!" replied the detective, shrugging his shoulders and turning on  his heel.    Passepartout was on the point of vigorously resenting the epithet, the  reason of which he could not for the life of him comprehend; but he  reflected that the unfortunate Fix was probably very much disappointed  and humiliated in his self-esteem, after having so awkwardly followed a  false scent around the world, and refrained.    And now what course would Phileas Fogg adopt?  It was difficult to  imagine.  Nevertheless he seemed to have decided upon one, for that  evening he sent for the engineer, and said to him, "Feed all the fires  until the coal is exhausted."    A few moments after, the funnel of the Henrietta vomited forth torrents  of smoke.  The vessel continued to proceed with all steam on; but on  the 18th, the engineer, as he had predicted, announced that the coal  would give out in the course of the day.    "Do not let the fires go down," replied Mr. Fogg.  "Keep them up to the  last.  Let the valves be filled."    Towards noon Phileas Fogg, having ascertained their position, called  Passepartout, and ordered him to go for Captain Speedy.  It was as if  the honest fellow had been commanded to unchain a tiger.  He went to  the poop, saying to himself, "He will be like a madman!"    In a few moments, with cries and oaths, a bomb appeared on the  poop-deck.  The bomb was Captain Speedy.  It was clear that he was on  the point of bursting.  "Where are we?"  were the first words his anger  permitted him to utter.  Had the poor man been an apoplectic, he could  never have recovered from his paroxysm of wrath.    "Where are we?" he repeated, with purple face.    "Seven hundred and seven miles from Liverpool," replied Mr. Fogg, with  imperturbable calmness.    "Pirate!" cried Captain Speedy.    "I have sent for you, sir--"    "Pickaroon!"    "--sir," continued Mr. Fogg, "to ask you to sell me your vessel."    "No!  By all the devils, no!"
