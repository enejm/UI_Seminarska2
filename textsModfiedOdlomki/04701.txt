long-legged girl stood on tiptoe to reach him.    "It _was_ your heart beating wildly," she decided a moment later. "Which  makes me think you might not just be trying to get rid of me by a silly  excuse."    "Believe me, I'm not," he urged. "Droozle is the key to all my  fortunes."    "All right, tell me about it. But first tell me where in the universe  you got him."    "Oh, that was just after I graduated from art school. I was on my grand  tour. We had an unexpected stopover at the Coffin planetary system. I  discovered ballpoint snakes are the chief export of Coffin Two. When we  lifted ship, I had acquired my little puppy snake, Droozle."    "Is a puppy snake like a puppy dog?" she asked, fascinated. "I mean, do  they have their little domestic troubles, such as the calls of nature?"    "Oh, he was thoroughly pocket-broken before I acquired him. But he did  like his little jokes, and I learned to leave him curled up in a  circular ashtray until maturity sobered him."    *       *       *       *       *    "Well, I should say! You drew sketches with him, didn't you tell me?"    He nodded. "At first he only had one color of ink--red--and if I  sketched with him all day he would commence to look wretchedly anemic.  He took two days to refill, normally. But I could use him again in only  one day's time provided I didn't mind the top three-fourths of my pen  laying on my arm."    "I hope his weight didn't get tiresome," she commiserated, holding in  her amusement.    "I coped somehow," he answered sturdily. "Later he learned--after I  squeezed him on the liver a few times just to show him how--to switch to  a lovely shade of ochre, which was delightful on pale green or pink  paper. Why, what's the matter, Judy?"    "Go on," she choked. "Go go go!"
