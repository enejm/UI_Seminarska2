seaward behind the isles and by North Berwick.    In the course of two hours or so, more and more ragged Highlandmen kept  collecting.  Neil among the first, until the party must have numbered  near a score.  With each new arrival there was a fresh bout of talk, that  sounded like complaints and explanations; but I observed one thing, none  of those who came late had any share in the division of my spoils.  The  last discussion was very violent and eager, so that once I thought they  would have quarrelled; on the heels of which their company parted, the  bulk of them returning westward in a troop, and only three, Neil and two  others, remaining sentries on the prisoner.    “I could name one who would be very ill pleased with your day’s work,  Neil Duncanson,” said I, when the rest had moved away.
