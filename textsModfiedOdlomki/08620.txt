“Mashune was still living, but a single glance at him told me that his  hour had come. The buffalo’s horn had driven a great hole in his right  lung, and inflicted other injuries.    “I knelt down beside him in the uttermost distress, and took his hand.    “‘Is he dead, Macumazahn?’ he whispered. ‘My eyes are blind; I cannot  see.’    “‘Yes, he is dead.’    “‘Did the black devil hurt thee, Macumazahn?’    “‘No, my poor fellow, I am not much hurt.’    “‘Ow! I am glad.’    “Then came a long silence, broken only by the sound of the air whistling  through the hole in his lung as he breathed.    “‘Macumazahn, art thou there? I cannot feel thee.’    “‘I am here, Mashune.’    “‘I die, Macumazahn--the world flies round and round. I go--I go out  into the dark! Surely, my father, at times in days to come--thou wilt  think of Mashune who stood by thy side--when thou killest elephants, as  we used--as we used----’    “They were his last words, his brave spirit passed with him. I dragged  his body to the hole under the tree, and pushed it in, placing his broad  assegai by him, according to the custom of his people, that he might not  go defenceless on his long journey; and then, ladies--I am not ashamed  to confess--I stood alone there before it, and wept like a woman.”            End of Project Gutenberg’s Hunter Quatermain’s Story, by H.
