She counted out the money to her brother and put on an apron. "What  should I do now, Bob?"    "Get the salt," Bob instructed.    He poured sardine oil from the can into the juicer, being very careful  not to let the sardines fall in. When he had squeezed the last drop of  oil out of the can, he ate all the sardines and tossed the can into the  sink.    Bonnie went after the salt and, when she lifted out the box, she found  a package containing two chocolate graham crackers.    "Mom has a new hiding place, Bob," she announced.    Bob looked up.
