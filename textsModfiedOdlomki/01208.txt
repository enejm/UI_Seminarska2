was so.        _IX_    IN THE CELLARS    At last, what with being tired and cold, and the uneasiness that  possessed me, I resolved to take a walk through the house; first calling  in at the study, for a glass of brandy to warm me. This, I did, and,  while there, I examined the door, carefully; but found all as I had left  it the night before.    The day was just breaking, as I left the tower; though it was still too  dark in the house to be able to see without a light, and I took one of  the study candles with me on my 'round. By the time I had finished the  ground floor, the daylight was creeping in, wanly, through the barred  windows. My search had shown me nothing fresh.

Indeed, save for the rummage 'round, already  mentioned, I doubt whether I had ever, before, been right through  the cellars.    As I unlocked the great door, at the top of the steps, I paused,
