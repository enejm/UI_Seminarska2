He managed to spend a month each year in the Colorado Rockies angling  for speckled beauties.    Larner was anything but a clock-watcher, but on a certain bright day in  June he was seated in his laboratory doing just that.    "Just five minutes to go," he mused.    It was just 4:25 P. M. He had finished his work, put his affairs in  order, and in five minutes would be free to leave on a much needed and  well earned vacation. His bags were packed and at the station. His  fishing tackle, the pride of his young life, was neatly rolled in oiled  silk and stood near at hand.    "I'll just fill my calabash, take one more quiet smoke, and then for the  mountains and freedom," he told himself. He settled back with his feet  on his desk. He half closed his eyes in solid comfort. Then the bomb  fell and exploded.    *       *       *       *       *    B-r-r-r-r!    The buzzer on his desk buzzed and his feet came off the desk and hit the  floor with a thud. His eyes popped open and the calabash was immediately  laid aside.    That buzzer usually meant business, and it would be his usual luck to  have trouble crash in on him just as he was on the edge of a rainbow  trout paradise.    A messenger was ushered into the room by an assistant. The boy handed  him an envelope, said, "No answer," and departed.    Larner tore open the envelope lazily. He read and then re-read its  contents, while a look of puzzled surprise disturbed his usually placid  countenance. He spread the sheet of paper out on his desk, and for the  tenth time he read:    Confidential.    Memorize this address and destroy this paper:    Tula Bela, 1726 88th Street, West, City of Hesper, Republic of  Pana, Planet Venus.
