 music.  But the two Ki-Ki frowned angrily, and the two Ki looked at the  boy in surprise, as if wondering at his temerity.    "Who are these strangers?" asked the pretty High Ki, speaking together  as all the twins of Twi did; "and why are they not mates, but only half  of each other?"    "These questions, your Supreme Highnesses," said the blond-haired pair  of Ki-Ki, "we are unable to answer."    "Perhaps, then, the strangers can answer themselves," said the little  maids, smiling first upon the Ki-Ki and then upon the prisoners.    Prince Marvel bowed.    "I am from the great outside world," said he, "and my name is Prince  Marvel.  Until now I have never seen people that live in pairs, and  speak in unison, and act in the same way and think the same thoughts.  My world is much bigger than your world, and in it every person is  proud to think and act for himself.  You say I am only a 'half,' but  that is not so.  I am perfect, without a counterpart; my friend Nerle  is perfect without a counterpart, and it is yourselves who are halved.  For in the Land of Twi no person is complete or perfect without its  other half, and it seems to take two of you to make one man--or one  maid."    The sweet faces of the twin High Ki grew thoughtful at this speech, and  they said:    "Indeed, it may be you are right.  But it is our custom in Twi to do  everything double and to live double." Then, turning to the Ki, they  asked: "Why have you brought these strangers here?"    "To ask your Supreme Highnesses to permit them to return again to the  world from whence they came," answered the Ki, both of them regarding  their supreme rulers earnestly.    But here the Ki-Ki spoke up quickly in their mild voices, saying:    "That is not our idea, your Highnesses.  We, the Ki-Ki of Twi, think it  best the strangers should be put to death.  And we pray your Supreme  Highnesses to favor our wish."
