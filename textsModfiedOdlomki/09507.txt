Leo, guard yourself. I believe that this is a trial sent to you, and  doubtless there will be more to follow. But I believe also that it would  be better for you to die than to make any mistake.”    “I know it well,” he answered; “and you need not be afraid. Whatever  this Khania may have been to me in the past--if she was anything at  all--that story is done with.
