 time, when he had recovered from his surprise at the sudden take-off.    "We do not need to know. Our machine is tuned to be attracted by the  planetary force of Venus alone. We could not go elsewhere. A repulsion  ray finds us as we near Venus and protects us against too violent a  landing. We will land on Venus like a feather about three months from  to-night."    The time of the journey through outer space was of little moment save  for one incident. Larner and the other travelers were suddenly and  rather rudely jostled about the rapidly flying craft.    Larner lost his breath but not his speech. "What happened?" he inquired.

Finally one evening during the journey to Venus,  when the travelers had been occupying themselves in a scientific  discussion of comparative evolution on the two planets, Larner saw his  opportunity.    "Why," he asked rather hesitatingly, "did the people of Venus always  remain so small? Why did you not strive more for height?

You think we are not tall because  you are used to taller people. Comparatively we are tall enough. In  proportion to the size of our planet we are exactly the right size. We
