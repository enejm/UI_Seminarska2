back to the earth's surface, were questions we could not even try to  answer.    *       *       *       *       *    We ate of the appetizing food laid out on the long table. Shortly  afterward we heard steps in the corridor outside the room.    A woman entered. She was ravishingly beautiful, tall, slender but  symmetrically rounded. A soft leather robe slanted upward across her  breast to a single shoulder fastening and ended just above her knees in  a skirt arrangement. Around her head was a regal circlet of silvery gray  metal with a flashing bit of crystal set in the center above her broad,  low forehead.    She smiled at Stanley who looked dazzled and smiled eagerly back.    She pointed toward the door, signifying that we were to go with her. We  did so; and were led down the great staircase and to a huge room that  took up half the ground floor of the building. And here we met the  nobility of the little kingdom--the upper class that governed the  immaculate little city.    They were standing along the walls, leaving a lane down the center of  the room--tall, finely modelled men and women dressed in the single  garments of soft leather. There were people there with gray hair and  wisdom wrinkled faces; but all were alike in being erect of body, firm  of bearing and in splendid health.    They stopped talking as we entered the big room. Our gaze strayed ahead  down the lane toward the further wall.    Here was a raised dais. On it was a gleaming crystal encrusted throne.  And occupying it was the most queenly, exquisitely beautiful woman I  had ever dreamed about.    *       *       *       *       *    Woman? She was just a girl in years in spite of her grave and royal air.
