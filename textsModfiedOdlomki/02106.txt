   I could see them in the moonlight across the pit. Perona now standing  up, the giant figure of the bandit towering over him.    *       *       *       *       *    Hanley's microscopic voice cut in: "Getting it, Phil? To seize you for  ransom!"    "Yes. I hear it."    "This girl. Who--?"    "Wait, Chief. Off--"    De Boer: "I will do it! Fifty thousand."    Perona: "An hour now. Spawn will be at his home asleep."
