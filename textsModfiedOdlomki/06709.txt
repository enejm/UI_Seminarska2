and that therefore the Germans must have landed. I crawled up the last  slope, quite forgetting the pursuit behind me.    And then I'm blessed if I did not look down on a veritable battle.    There were two sets of trenches with barbed wire and all the fixings,  one set filled with troops and the other empty. On these latter shells  were bursting, but there was no sign of life in them. In the other  lines there seemed the better part of two brigades, and the first  trench was stiff with bayonets. My first thought was that Home Forces  had gone dotty, for this kind of show could have no sort of training  value. And then I saw other things--cameras and camera-men on platforms  on the flanks, and men with megaphones behind them on wooden  scaffoldings.

You know how a photographer finicks about and is  dissatisfied with a pose that seems all right to his sitter. I should
