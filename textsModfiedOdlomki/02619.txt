instantly, any orders that may be issued: I know that last remark is  not needed. If any of you should see or learn something of interest or  value, report at once to Mr. Correy, Mr. Kincaide or my--"    A simultaneous, involuntary exclamation from the men interrupted me,  and it was not surprising that this was so, for the wall before us had  suddenly opened, and there was a great burst of yellow light in our  faces. A strong odor, like the faint scent we had first noticed in the  air, but infinitely more powerful, struck our nostrils, but I was not  conscious of the fact for several seconds. My whole attention, my  every startled thought, was focused upon the group of strange beings,  silhouetted against the glowing light, that stood in the opening.    *       *       *       *       *    Imagine, if you can, a huge globe, perhaps eight feet in diameter,  flattened slightly at the bottom, and supported on six short, huge  stumps, like the feet of an elephant, and topped by an excrudescence  like a rounded coning tower, merging into the globular body. From  points slightly below this excrudescence, visualize six long, limp  tentacles, so long that they drop from the equators of these animated  spheres, and trail on the ground. Now you have some conception of the  beings that stood before us.    A sharp, sibilant whispering came from one of these figures, to be  answered in an eager chorus from our bearers. There was a reply like a  command, and the group in the doorway marched forward. One by one  these visible tentacles wrapped themselves around a member of the  _Ertak's_ crew, each one of the globular creatures bearing one of us.    I heard a disappointed whisper go up from the outer darkness where,  but a moment before, we had been. Then there was a grating sound, and  a thud as the stone doorway was rolled back into place.    The entrance was sealed. We were prisoners indeed!
