  D'Arnot glanced at the title page.    "It is the diary of John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, an English nobleman,  and it is written in French," he said.    Then he proceeded to read the diary that had been written over twenty  years before, and which recorded the details of the story which we  already know--the story of adventure, hardships and sorrow of John  Clayton and his wife Alice, from the day they left England until an  hour before he was struck down by Kerchak.
