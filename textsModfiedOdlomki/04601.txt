and our fortune. It is the muscle and bone of our trade. Earthmen may  come and Earthmen may go, but clay goes on forever ... and with it, the  fame and fortune of the House of Masur."    "It _is_ a damned imposition," agreed Morvan, ignoring his father's  philosophical attitude. "They could have landed just as easily here in  Lor."    "The Thorabians will lick up the gravy," said Singula, whose mind ran  rather to matters of financial aspect, "and leave us the grease."    By this, he seemed to imply that the Thorabians would rob the Earthmen,  which the Lorians would not. The truth was that all on Zur were panting  to get their hands on that marvelous ship, which was all of metal, a  very scarce commodity on Zur, worth billions of ken.    *       *       *       *       *    Lubiosa, who had interests in Thorabia, and many agents there, kept his  own counsel. His people were active in the matter and that was enough  for him. He would report when the time was ripe.    "Doubtless," said Zotul unexpectedly, for the youngest at a conference  was expected to keep his mouth shut and applaud the decisions of his  elders, "the Earthmen used all the metal on their planet in building  that ship. We cannot possibly bilk them of it; it is their only means  of transport."    Such frank expression of motive was unheard of, even in the secret  conclave of conference. Only the speaker's youth could account for it.  The speech drew scowls from the brothers and stern rebuke from Koltan.    "When your opinion is wanted, we will ask you for it. Meantime,  remember your position in the family."    Zotul bowed his head meekly, but he burned with resentment.    "Listen to the boy," said the aged father. "There is more wisdom in his  head than in all the rest of you. Forget the Earthmen and think only of  the clay."
