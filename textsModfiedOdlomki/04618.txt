The clerk who took his application for  an interview was, he noticed only vaguely, a young Earthwoman. It  was remarkable that he paid so little attention, for the female  terrestrials were picked for physical assets that made Zurian men  covetous and Zurian women envious.    "The governor will see you," she said sweetly. "He has been expecting  you."    "Me?" marveled Zotul.    She ushered him into the magnificent private office of the governor  of Lor.
