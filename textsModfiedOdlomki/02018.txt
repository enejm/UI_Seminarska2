sir--America's foremost scientist, though she may never realize it,"  with a piping chuckle. "To-night there will be a great banquet in your  honor. Meanwhile, suppose I show you to your quarters."    Nettled, fuming, though outwardly calm, Kendrick permitted himself to  be escorted from the laboratory to an ornate apartment on one of the  lower floors.    There Cor left him, with the polite hint that he would find plenty of  attendants handy should he require anything.    Alone now, in the midst of this vast, nightmarish metropolis, he paced  back and forth, back and forth--knowing the hideous fate that  threatened the world but powerless to issue one word of warning, much  less avert it.    *       *       *       *       *    Kendrick was still thinking and brooding along these lines when he saw  the door of the apartment swiftly open and close again.    Someone had entered, invisible!    Backing away, he waited, tense. Then, suddenly, his visitor  materialized. With a gasp, he saw standing before him a beautiful  girl.    She was a young woman, rather, in her early twenties. Not one of these  pigmies of the disc either, but a tall, slender creature of his own  world.    Her hair was dark, modishly bobbed. Her eyes were a deep, clear brown,  her skin a warm olive. And she was dressed as though she had just  stepped off Fifth Avenue--which indeed she had, not so long ago, as  he was soon to learn.    "I hope I haven't startled you too much, Mr. Kendrick," she said, in a  rich, husky murmur, "but--well, there wasn't any other way."    "Oh, I guess I'll get over it," he replied with a smile. "But you have  the advantage of me, since you know my name."    Hers was Marjorie Blake, she told him then.    "Not the daughter of Henderson Blake?" he gasped.    "Yes," with a tremor, "his only daughter."
