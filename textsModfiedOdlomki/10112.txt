 But the balloon did not budge.    “Humph!” said he; “we’re not going up yet.”    “Not yet,” said the doctor. “Keep on throwing.”    Kennedy laughed. Joe now threw out some ten pounds, but the balloon  stood still.    Joe got very pale.    “Poor fellow!” said the doctor. “Mr. Kennedy, you and I weigh, unless I  am mistaken, about four hundred pounds--so that you’ll have to get rid  of at least that weight, since it was put in here to make up for us.”    “Throw away four hundred pounds!” said Joe, piteously.    “And some more with it, or we can’t rise. Come, courage, Joe!”    The brave fellow, heaving deep sighs, began at last to lighten the  balloon; but, from time to time, he would stop, and ask:    “Are you going up?”    “No, not yet,” was the invariable response.    “It moves!” said he, at last.    “Keep on!” replied the doctor.    “It’s going up; I’m sure.”    “Keep on yet,” said Kennedy.    And Joe, picking up one more block, desperately tossed it out of the  car. The balloon rose a hundred feet or so, and, aided by the cylinder,  soon passed above the surrounding summits.    “Now, Joe,” resumed the doctor, “there still remains a handsome fortune  for you; and, if we can only keep the rest of this with us until the end  of our trip, there you are--rich for the balance of your days!”    Joe made no answer, but stretched himself out luxuriously on his heap of  quartz.    “See, my dear Dick!” the doctor went on. “Just see the power of this  metal over the cleverest lad in the world! What passions, what greed,  what crimes, the knowledge of such a mine as that would cause! It is sad  to think of it!”    By evening the balloon had made ninety miles to the westward, and was,  in a direct line, fourteen hundred miles from Zanzibar.        CHAPTER TWENTY-FOURTH.
