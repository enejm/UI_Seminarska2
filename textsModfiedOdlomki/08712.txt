nor believe, and oh! you vex me sorely. Now I had it in my mind to  tell you the secret of this long life of mine; long, mark you, but not  endless, for doubtless I must die and change and return again, like  others, and even to show you how it may be won. But you are not worthy  in your faithlessness.”    “No, no, I am not worthy,” I answered, who at that moment did not feel  the least desire to live two thousand years, perhaps with this woman as  a neighbour, rating me from generation to generation. Yet it is true,  that now when I am older and a certain event cannot be postponed much  longer, I do often regret that I neglected to take this unique chance,  if in truth there was one, of prolonging an existence which after all  has its consolations--especially when one has made one’s pile. Certainly  it is a case, a flagrant case, of neglected opportunities, and my only  consolation for having lost them is that this was due to the uprightness  of my nature which made it so hard for me to acquiesce in alternative  statements that I had every cause to disbelieve and thus to give offence  to a very powerful and petulant if attractive lady.    “So that is done with,” she went on with a little stamp of indignation,  “as soon you will be also, who, had you not crossed and doubted me,  might have lived on for untold time and become one of the masters of the  world, as I am.”    Here she paused, choked, I think, with her almost childish anger, and  because I could not help it, I said,    “Such place and power, if they be yours, Ayesha, do not seem to bring  you much reward. If I were a master of the world I do not think that I  should choose to dwell unchangingly among savages who eat men and in  a pile of ruins. But perhaps the curses of Aphrodite and of Isis are  stronger masters still?” and I paused inquiringly.    This bold argument--for now I see that it was bold--seemed to astonish  and even bewilder my wonderful companion.
