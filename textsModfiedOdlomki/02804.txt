you get that stone?"    Junior contracted guiltily. The surfstone slipped from his tentacles  and plumped to the sea-floor in a flurry of sand. He edged away,  stammering, "Well, I guess maybe ... I might have gone a little ways  toward the beach...."    "You guess! When I was a polyp," said Pater, "the small fry obeyed  their elders, and no guess about it!"    "Now, dear--" said Mater.    "And no spawn of mine," Pater warmed to his lecture, "is going to flout  my words! Junior--COME HERE!"    Junior paddled cautiously around the homesite, just out of  tentacle-reach. He said in a small voice, "I won't."    "DID YOU HEAR ME?"    "Yes," admitted Junior.    The neighbors stared.

Why, my dear, do you realize  what this _means_?"    *       *       *       *       *    Pater was once more occupied with improving Mater's mind. It was a long  job, without foreseeable end--especially since he and his helpmeet were  both firmly rooted for life to the same tastefully decorated homesite
