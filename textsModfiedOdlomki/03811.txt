Then we are going through dirt again and all of a sudden we come out of  it and I see a city below us all lit up and the buildings are made of  stuff that looks like jade run through with streaks of black.    The Mole drops down about a thousand more feet and then hits the floor  of the subterranean city and we land like a fountain pen with its point  slammed into the top of a lump of clay. Bo-o-o-o-i-ing! We twang like a  plucked harp string for nearly five minutes and I hit my noggin against  the pilot's seat.    When I pick up my marbles I look around for either an Elysium field or a  slag heap but instead a creep is staring down at me. He looks part human  and part beetle and has a face the color of the meat of an avocado. His  head is shaped like a pear standing on its stem and has two eyes spaced  about six inches apart and they are as friendly as those of a spitting  cobra irked by hives. He is about four feet tall and has two pairs of  arms. I guess I am still a little delirious or I would not have told  the thing he would make a swell paper hanger.    The subterranean creep throws a fit and belts me with four fists.  "Dummkopf!" it says, and then I really get scared as he has got a lop of  hair falling down over one eye and has a black mustache the size of a  Venutian four centra stamp over his mouth which is like that of a  pouting goldfish.    I get to my feet and grab for a railing, and I see Wurpz and Zahooli  held by two other monsters that look more like beetles than the one  standing beside me.    "Zo!" the creep with the mustache says. "It is a surprise I talk  Universa? We have radar and telepathometers that give us everything that  is said in the upper world."    I think back and try not to. In the hermetically sealed cylinder back  upstairs among my Americana Spink I have some photographs, Circa 1945.
