   But the Woggle-Bug strutted along as if he had made some brilliant remark,  and the Scarecrow was obliged to say:    "I have heard, my dear friend, that a person can become over-educated; and  although I have a high respect for brains, no matter how they may be  arranged or classified, I begin to suspect that yours are slightly tangled.  In any event, I must beg you to restrain your superior education while in  our society."    "We are not very particular," added the Tin Woodman; "and we are exceedingly  kind hearted. But if your superior culture gets leaky again--" He did not  complete the sentence, but he twirled his gleaming axe so carelessly that  the Woggle-Bug looked frightened, and shrank away to a safe distance.

When they again stopped to allow Tip to rest--the boy being the only one  that seemed to tire--the Tin Woodman noticed many small, round holes in  the grassy meadow.    "This must be a village of the Field Mice," he said to the Scarecrow." I  wonder if my old friend, the Queen of the Mice, is in this neighborhood."    "If she is, she may be of great service to us," answered the Scarecrow, who  was impressed by a sudden thought. "See if you can call her, my dear Nick."

For the Tin Woodman had once saved her  life, and the Queen of the Field Mice knew he was to be trusted."    "Good day, your Majesty, said Nick, politely addressing the mouse; "I trust  you are enjoying good health?"
