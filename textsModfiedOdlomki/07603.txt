this?”    “And who told you this fine story, sire?” asked Treville, quietly.    “Who has told me this fine story, monsieur? Who should it be but he who  watches while I sleep, who labors while I amuse myself, who conducts  everything at home and abroad--in France as in Europe?”    “Your Majesty probably refers to God,” said M. de Treville; “for I know  no one except God who can be so far above your Majesty.”    “No, monsieur; I speak of the prop of the state, of my only servant, of  my only friend--of the cardinal.”    “His Eminence is not his holiness, sire.”    “What do you mean by that, monsieur?”    “That it is only the Pope who is infallible, and that this infallibility  does not extend to cardinals.”    “You mean to say that he deceives me; you mean to say that he betrays  me? You accuse him, then? Come, speak; avow freely that you accuse him!”    “No, sire, but I say that he deceives himself. I say that he is  ill-informed. I say that he has hastily accused your Majesty’s  Musketeers, toward whom he is unjust, and that he has not obtained his  information from good sources.”    “The accusation comes from Monsieur de la Tremouille, from the duke  himself. What do you say to that?”    “I might answer, sire, that he is too deeply interested in the question  to be a very impartial witness; but so far from that, sire, I know the  duke to be a royal gentleman, and I refer the matter to him--but upon  one condition, sire.”    “What?”    “It is that your Majesty will make him come here, will interrogate him  yourself, TETE-A-TETE, without witnesses, and that I shall see your  Majesty as soon as you have seen the duke.”    “What, then! You will bind yourself,” cried the king, “by what Monsieur  de la Tremouille shall say?”    “Yes, sire.”    “You will accept his judgment?”    “Undoubtedly.”    “And you will submit to the reparation he may require?”    “Certainly.”
