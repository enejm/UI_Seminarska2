about some new theory I was always puzzled.    "It was at such a time, when we had been discussing the new and first  successful attempt to send moving pictures by radio, that I mentioned  the prophecy of Jackson Gee. Gee was the writer of fantastic,  pseudo-scientific tales who had said: 'We shall soon be able to  resolve human beings into their constituent elements, transmit them by  radio to any desired point and reassemble them at the other end. We  shall do this by means of vibrations. We are just beginning to learn  that vibrations are the key to the fundamental process of all life.'    *       *       *       *       *    "I laughed as I quoted this to Drayle, for it seemed to me the ravings  of a lunatic. But Drayle did not smile. 'Jackson Gee,' he said, 'is  nearer to the truth than he imagines. We already know the elements  that make the human body, and we can put them together in their proper  proportions and arrangements: but we have not been able to introduce  the vitalizing spark, the key vibrations to start it going. We can  reproduce the human machine, but we can not make it move. We can  destroy life in the laboratory, and we can prolong it, but so far we  have not been able to create it. Yet I tell you in all seriousness  that that time will come; that time will come.'    "I was surprised at his earnestness and would have questioned him  further. But a boy appeared just then with a message that Drayle was  wanted at the telephone.    "Something important, sir," he said. Drayle went off to answer the  summons and later he sent word that he had been called away and would  not be able to return.    "It was the last I heard from Drayle for months. He shut himself in  his laboratory and saw no one but his assistants, Ward of Boston, and  Buchannon of Washington. He even slept in the workshop and had his
