"I am not a Zen," I told her, giving my torch full brilliance for the  crew's sake, "but Yurt here is. Do you see ... I mean, do you know what  you look like?"    She said, "I can see enough of my own body to--and--yes ..."    "Yurt," I said, "here's the female we thought we might find. Take over."    Yurt's eyes were fastened on the girl.    "What--do I do now?" she whispered worriedly.    "I'm afraid that's something only a Zen would know," I told her,  smiling inside my helmet. "I'm not a Zen. Yurt is."    She turned to him. "You will tell me?"    "If it becomes necessary." He moved closer to her, not even looking back  to talk to me. "Give us some time to get acquainted, will you, Dave? And  you might leave some supplies and a bubble at the camp when you move on,  just to make things pleasanter."    By this time he had reached the female. They were as still as space, not  a sound, not a motion. I wanted to hang around, but I knew how I'd feel  if a Zen, say, wouldn't go away if I were the last man alive and had  just met the last woman.    I moved my torch off them and headed back for the _Lucky Pierre_. We all  had a drink to the saving of a great race that might have become  extinct. Ed Reiss, though, had to do some worrying before he could down  his drink.    "What if they don't like each other?" he asked anxiously.    "They don't have much choice," Captain Feldman said, always the realist.  "Why do homely women fight for jobs on the most isolated space  outposts?"    Reiss grinned. "That's right. They look awful good after a year or two  in space."    "Make that twenty-five by Zen standards or three thousand by ours," said  Joe Hargraves, "and I'll bet they look beautiful to each other."    We decided to drop our investigation of Vesta for the time being, and  come back to it after the honeymoon.
