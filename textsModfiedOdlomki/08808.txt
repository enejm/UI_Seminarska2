 1,640 feet above sea level.    “What place is this?” I asked of the two Mazitu guides, those same men  whom we had borrowed from Hassan.    “The land of our people, Chief,” they answered, “which is bordered on  one side by the bush and on the other by the great lake where live the  Pongo wizards.”    I looked about me at the bare uplands that already were beginning to  turn brown, on which nothing was visible save vast herds of buck such as  were common further south. A dreary prospect it was, for a slight rain  was falling, accompanied by mist and a cold wind.    “I do not see your people or their kraals,” I said; “I only see grass  and wild game.”    “Our people will come,” they replied, rather nervously. “No doubt even  now their spies watch us from among the tall grass or out of some hole.”    “The deuce they do,” I said, or something like it, and thought no more  of the matter. When one is in conditions in which anything _may_ happen,  such as, so far as I am concerned, have prevailed through most of my  life, one grows a little careless as to what _will_ happen. For my part  I have long been a fatalist, to a certain extent. I mean I believe that  the individual, or rather the identity which animates him, came out from  the Source of all life a long while, perhaps hundreds of thousands or  millions of years ago, and when his career is finished, perhaps hundreds  of thousands or millions of years hence, or perhaps to-morrow, will  return perfected, but still as an individual, to dwell in or with that  Source of Life. I believe also that his various existences, here or  elsewhere, are fore-known and fore-ordained, although in a sense he may  shape them by the action of his free will, and that nothing which he can  do will lengthen or shorten one of them by a single hour. Therefore, so  far as I am concerned, I have always acted up to the great injunction of  our Master and taken no thought for the morrow.
