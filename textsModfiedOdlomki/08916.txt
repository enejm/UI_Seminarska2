unseen by us, had been led out of the prison hut.    “Yes, yes, we know her,” said a little ring of headmen, who formed  the primitive court of justice, and after the fashion of natives had  squatted themselves in a circle on the ground in front of us. “We know  her, she is the white Babyan-woman, she is Hendrika, the body servant of  the Star.”    “You know her,” said Mr. Carson, “but you do not know her altogether.  Stand forward, Indaba-zimbi, and tell the people what came about last  night in the hut of Macumazahn.”    Accordingly old Indaba-zimbi came forward, and, squatting down, told his  moving tale with much descriptive force and many gestures, finishing up  by producing the great knife from which his watchfulness had saved me.
