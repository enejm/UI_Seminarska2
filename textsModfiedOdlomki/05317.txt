"No," said the Hawk.    "You'll find it interesting. Let me read it to you." And Tantril took  up the memo.    "From Ku Sui to Lar Tantril: Search House No. 574 in Port o' Porno  closely for anything pertinent to Master Scientist Eliot Leithgow or  giving clue to his whereabouts. Keep what you obtain for me; I will  come to your ranch in five days. Watch for Hawk Carse, Eliot Leithgow  and a Negro, arriving from space at Satellite III in self-propulsive  space-suits." There followed some details concerning the suits'  mechanism; then: "Carse caused me certain trouble and came near  hurting my major inventions. I want him badly."    *       *       *       *       *    At this the adventurer's face tightened; his gray eyes went frosty.  All he and Leithgow had deduced, then, was true. Dr. Ku had survived  the crashing of the asteroid's dome. The mechanisms had also  survived--and certainly the coordinated brains--the brains he, Hawk  Carse, had promised to destroy! Now trapped, it seemed that promise  could never be fulfilled....    Yet even through this torturing thought of a promise unkept, the  Hawk's thumb and forefinger moved in their slight grinding motion on  the first sheet of the sheaf of papers....    Lar Tantril reached out his hand for the sheaf. "So, obeying Dr. Ku's  orders, I had the house searched and got these papers. They, must be  valuable, Carse, since you wanted them so badly. Ku Sui will be  pleased. Hand them over."    With but the barest flick of gray eyes downward. Hawk Carse gave the  sheaf to Tantril.    But his brief glance at the top-most sheet told him all he wanted to  know. Gradually, methodically, the motion of thumb and forefinger had  totally effaced the revealing figure 5,576.34, the one clue to the  location of Leithgow's laboratory. Enough! What he had set out to do  was finished. The chief task was achieved!    "And now, perhaps," Lar Tantril chuckled, "a little entertainment."
