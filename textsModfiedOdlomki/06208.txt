a sheer act of will. "I think Charl's right about this being a  feeding-ground, Alaskon. I hear something moving around in the ferns.  And if this rain lasts long, the water will rise here, too. I've seen  silver flashes from down here many a time after heavy rains."    "That's right," Mathild said, her voice subdued. "The base of the  fan-palm grove always floods.

And the first day had barely begun.    *       *       *       *       *    They toiled all the rest of the day to reach higher ground. As they
