   Thurston found his voice. "Let me have that Very pistol. If light hurts  that damn thing, I am going to put a blaze of magnesium into the middle  of it if I die for it."    "They're all gone," said Riley.    "Then let's get out of here. I've had enough. We can come back later  on."    He got back of the wheel and slammed the door of the sedan. The  moonlight was gone. The darkness was velvet just tinged with the gray  that precedes the dawn. Back in the deeper blackness at the cliff-base a  phosphorescent something wavered and glowed. The light rippled and  flowed in all directions over the mass. Thurston felt, vaguely, its  mystery--the bulk was a vast, naked brain; its quiverings were like  visible thought waves....    *       *       *       *       *    The phosphorescence grew brighter.
