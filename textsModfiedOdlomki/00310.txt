 congratulate you, Guph, upon the wonderful success of your journey."    "But that is not all," said the General, proudly.    The King seemed astonished.  "Speak out, sir!" he commanded.    "I have seen the First and Foremost Phanfasm of the Mountain of  Phantastico, and he will bring his people to assist us."    "What!" cried the King.  "The Phanfasms!  You don't mean it, Guph!"

"When the tunnel is completed," said the General.    "We are nearly halfway under the desert now," announced the King; "and  that is fast work, because the tunnel has to be drilled through solid  rock.  But after we have passed the desert it will not take us long to
