"Yes," said the other man.    "Nonsense," said the woman. She went back to the cave and the young man  put the end of his spear into the fire and tried to scrape the side of  the pot with the flint head, but the flint was cold and it cracked. He  pulled it back and was looking angrily at it when she came out again  and sat on the ground. She had an armful of roots which she began to  scrape with a sharp stone. "The spearhead is made of the wrong sort  of stone," she said, without looking up. "That is why it broke in the  fire."    "It's made of the _right_ kind!" the young man shouted. "All spearheads  are made of that kind! They always have been and they always will be!  How did _you_ know it broke in the fire? You weren't looking."    "I heard it make the sound it makes when the fire breaks it."    The young man glowered and pushed his under lip out. "This kind of  stone was put in the cave for us to make knives and spears. And it  makes a very sharp edge when you know how to form it."    "No sharper than this knife," she said, holding up the stone in her  hand. "This doesn't break so easily."    The young man took it and examined it carefully. "How do you strike  it to make it this shape?" he said, and then, grudgingly, "It is very  smooth--a very good shape."    "You don't strike it," she said, taking it back and going on scraping  the roots. "You rub it on another stone--first on the kind that has the  bright sparkles in it, and then under water on the flat gray kind. It's  much better than your knives and the fire doesn't break it so easily."    *       *       *       *       *    She finished with the roots and put them in the pot with the meat.    "Where do you find such big roots?" the young man asked his brother.
