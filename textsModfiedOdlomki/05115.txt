  "This is the police. Open up!"    "I won't unless you have a warrant!"    There was no more shouting. They seemed to be parlaying among  themselves, but the crowd had a menacing sound. A brilliant light  suddenly hit our windows, illuminating the lab ceiling--a police  searchlight. I saw that Molly had disappeared and I assumed she had  gone into McGill's office.    "These guys mean business," he said, "but what the hell brought them?"    "Something on the roof. That's what they're all looking at, so why  don't we go up and see?"    "All right, but you'd better stay down here. There's no parapet and  they'll see you."    He started for the door and I decided to follow--at least as far as the  trapdoor, or whatever gave onto the roof--when Molly came in from the  hall. She looked scared.    "My God! I climbed an iron ladder and took a look outside. There's a  small cyclone over us--a ton of torn papers and dust and junk whirling  around like a waterspout! They'd be able to see it for blocks!"    "Oh, great," McGill groaned. "Now it's playing tricks with the wind.  That's how they spotted us."    "We've got to get out of here, McGill," said Molly.    "Maybe the best thing would be for me to give myself up to the cops," I  said.    "I don't know whether they'd be able to get you through that mob,"  McGill replied. "Just listen to them. I only wish I could think of some  way to satisfy the damn crystal or whatever it is. I have the feeling  it wants something. It can't be merely fooling around for no reason.  But there doesn't seem to be any motive beyond the fact that it's  apparently on your side. How did it start? That's what I wish I knew."    He absently turned the bench lamp on again. I shrugged unhappily and  scratched my cheek. In so doing, I pulled the piece of pink adhesive  tape loose and it began to bleed again.    "Cut yourself shaving, darling?" Molly asked me.
