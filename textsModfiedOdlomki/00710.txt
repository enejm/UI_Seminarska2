   When the stranger ceased speaking, a great silence fell on the  assemblage, for the beasts were thinking of what he had said.  Finally  one of the walruses asked:    "Can you really transform beasts into men, and men into beasts?"    "He can--he can!" cried Loo the Unicorn, prancing up and down in an  excited manner.  "He transformed ME, only last evening, and he can  transform us all."    Gugu the King now stepped forward.    "You have heard the stranger speak," said he, "and now you must answer  him.  It is for you to decide.  Shall we agree to this plan, or not?"    "Yes!" shouted some of the animals.    "No!" shouted others.    And some were yet silent.    Gugu looked around the great circle.

Ruggedo the Nome waved his arms and fluttered his wings to try to make  them listen to him again, but the beasts paid no attention.  Some  wanted to fight the Oz people, some wanted to be transformed, and some  wanted to do nothing at all.    The growling and confusion had grown greater than ever when in a flash  silence fell on all the beasts present, the arguments were hushed, and  all gazed in astonishment at a strange sight.
