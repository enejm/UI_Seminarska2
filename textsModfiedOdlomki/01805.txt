A nameless little  stream flowed placidly through the night and, beached where  impenetrable undergrowth crowded to the water's edge, a big amphibian  plane lay slightly askew, while a light glowed brightly in its cabin.  More, from that cabin there presently emerged the incredible sound of  music, played in Rio for _os gentes_ of the distinctly upper strata of  society by a bored but beautifully trained orchestra.
