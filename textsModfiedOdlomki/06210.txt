on up the slope which led toward the pink cliffs.    *       *       *       *       *    Late that afternoon, the three found the blue, turbulent stream flowing  out of the foothills of the Great Range. Not even Alaskon knew quite  what to make of it. It looked like water, but it flowed like the rivers  of lava that crept downward from the volcanoes. Whatever else it could  be, obviously it wasn't water; water stood, it never flowed. It was  possible to imagine a still body of water as big as this, but only in a  moment of fancy, an exaggeration derived from the known bodies of water  in the tank-plants. But this much water in motion? It suggested pythons;  it was probably poisonous. It did not occur to any of them to drink from  it. They were afraid even to touch it, let alone cross it, for it was  almost surely as hot as the other kinds of lava-rivers. They followed  its course cautiously into the foothills, their throats as dry and  gritty as the hollow stems of horsetails.    Except for the thirst--which was in an inverted sense their friend,  insofar as it overrode the hunger--the climbing was not difficult. It  was only circuitous, because of the need to stay under cover, to  reconnoiter every few yards, to choose the most sheltered course rather  than the most direct.
