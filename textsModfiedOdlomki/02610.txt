  He opened a double panel in the shell's hull, and freed the little  animal. In an agony of suspense they watched it as it leaped onto the  bare lava and halted a moment....    "Seems to like it," said Joyce, drawing a great breath.    The rat, as though intoxicated by its sudden freedom, raced away out  of sight, covering eight or ten feet at a bound, its legs scurrying  ludicrously in empty air during its short flights.    "That means that we can dispense with oxygen helmets--and that we'd  better take our guns," said Wichter, his voice tense, his eyes  snapping behind his glasses.    He stepped to the gun rack. In this were half a dozen air-guns.

It was the most  powerful explosive yet found, but one that was beautifully safe to  carry inasmuch as it could be exploded only by heat.    "Are we ready?" he said, handing a gun to Joyce.
