"I want my girl back," said Fraser tonelessly. "I was hoping my  nuisance-value--"    *       *       *       *       *    Kennedy winced a bit. "You know, I'm damned sorry about that. It's the  one aspect of my work which I hate. I'd like you to believe that I'm not  just a scientific procurer. Actually, I have to satisfy the minor  desires of my clients, so they'll stay happy and agree to my major  wishes. It's the plain truth that those women have been only the  minutest fraction of my job."    "Nevertheless, you're a free-wheeling son, doing something like that--"    "Really, now, what's so horrible about it? Those girls are in love--the  normal, genuine article. It's not any kind of zombie state, or whatever  your overheated imagination has thought up. They're entirely sane,  unharmed, and happy. In fact, happiness of that kind is so rare in this  world that if I wanted to, I could pose as their benefactor."    "You've got a machine," said Fraser; "it changes the mind. As far as I'm  concerned, that's as gross a violation of liberty as throwing somebody  into a concentration camp."    "How free do you think anyone is? You're born with a fixed heredity.  Environment molds you like clay. Your society teaches you what and how  to think. A million tiny factors, all depending on blind, uncontrollable  chance, determine the course of your life--including your love-life....  Well, we needn't waste any time on philosophy. Go on, ask some  questions. I admit I've hurt you--unwittingly, to be sure--but I do want  to make amends."    "Your machine, then," said Fraser. "How did you get it? How does it  work."    "I was practicing in Chicago," said Kennedy, "and collaborating on the  side with Gavotti. How much do you know of cybernetics? I don't mean  computers and automata, which are only one aspect of the field; I mean  control and communication, in the animal as well as in the machine."
