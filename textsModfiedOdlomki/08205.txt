hours before, that I should ever have courage to do this by night in the  Mohune vault, I would not have believed him. Yet here I was, and had  advanced along the path of terror so gradually, and as it were foot by  foot in the past night, that when I came to this final step I was not  near so scared as when I first felt my way into the vault. It was not the  first time either that I had looked on death; but had, indeed, always a  leaning to such sights and matters, and had seen corpses washed up from  the _Darius_ and other wrecks, and besides that had helped Ratsey to case  some poor bodies that had died in their beds.    The coffin was, as I have said, of great length, and the side being  removed, I could see the whole outline of the skeleton that lay in it. I  say the outline, for the form was wrapped in a woollen or flannel shroud,  so that the bones themselves were not visible. The man that lay in it was  little short of a giant, measuring, as I guessed, a full six and a half  feet, and the flannel having sunk in over the belly, the end of the  breast-bone, the hips, knees, and toes were very easy to be made out. The  head was swathed in linen bands that had been white, but were now stained  and discoloured with damp, but of this I shall not speak more, and  beneath the chin-cloth the beard had once escaped. The clutch which I had  made to save myself in falling had torn away this chin-band and let the  lower jaw drop on the breast; but little else was disturbed, and there  was Colonel John Mohune resting as he had been laid out a century ago. I  lifted that portion of the lid which had been left behind, and reached  over to see if there was anything hid on the other side of the body; but  had scarce let the light fall in the coffin when my heart gave a great  bound, and all fear left me in the flush of success, for there I saw what  I had come to seek.
