But, then, I don't believe I ever saw these lovers----?"    "John was a well-set man of about five-and-twenty," replied Mr. Pope;  "and Sarah was a brown woman of eighteen years, three months and  fourteen days."    Then these two dipped their pens and set about a moving composition,  which has to-day its proper rating among Mr. Pope's Complete Works.          PRO HONORIA      "_But that sense of negation, of theoretic insecurity, which was in the  air, conspiring with what was of like tendency in himself, made of Lord  UFFORD a central type of disillusion. . . .  He had been amiable  because the general betise of humanity did not in his opinion greatly  matter, after all; and in reading these 'SATIRES' it is well-nigh  painful to witness the blind and naked forces of nature and  circumstance surprising him in the uncontrollable movements of his own  so carefully guarded heart._"        Why is a handsome wife adored  By every coxcomb but her lord?    From yonder puppet-man inquire  Who wisely hides his wood and wire;  Shows Sheba's queen completely dress'd  And Solomon in royal vest;    But view them litter'd on the floor,  Or strung on pegs behind the door,  Punch is exactly of a piece  With Lorrain's duke, and prince of Greece.    HORACE CALVERLEY.--_Petition to the Duke of Ormskirk_.          PRO HONORIA    In the early winter of 1761 the Earl of Bute, then Secretary of State,  gave vent to an outburst of unaccustomed profanity.  Mr. Robert  Calverley, who represented England at the Court of St. Petersburg, had  resigned his office without prelude or any word of explanation.  This  infuriated Bute, since his pet scheme was to make peace with Russia and  thereby end the Continental War.  Now all was to do again; the minister  raged, shrugged, furnished a new emissary with credentials, and marked  Calverley's name for punishment.
