  "Give it to the poor," said Prince Marvel, promptly.    "What poor?"    "Oh, the poorest people I can find."    "Will you permit me to advise you in this matter?" asked the king of  thieves, politely.    "Yes, indeed; for I am a stranger in this land," returned the prince.    "Well, I know a lot of people who are so poor that they have no  possessions whatever, neither food to eat, houses to live in, nor any  clothing but that which covers their bodies.  They can call no man  friend, nor will any lift a hand to help them.  Indeed, good sir, I  verily believe they will soon perish miserably unless you come to their  assistance!"    "Poor creatures!" exclaimed Prince Marvel, with ready sympathy; "tell  me who they are, and I will divide amongst them all your ill-gotten  gains."    "They are ourselves," replied the king of thieves, with a sigh.    Marvel looked at him in amazement, and then burst into joyous laughter.    "Yourselves!" he cried, greatly amused.    "Indeed, yes!" said Wul-Takim, sadly.  "There are no poorer people in  all the world, for we have ropes about our necks and are soon to be  hanged.  To-morrow we shall not have even our flesh left, for the crows  will pick our bones."    "That is true," remarked Marvel, thoughtfully.  "But, if I restore to  you the treasure, how will it benefit you, since you are about to die?"    "Must you really hang us?" asked the thief.    "Yes; I have decreed it, and you deserve your fate."    "Why?"    "Because you have wickedly taken from helpless people their property,  and committed many other crimes besides."    "But I have reformed!  We have all reformed--have we not, brothers?"    "We have!" answered the other thieves, who, having regained their  senses, were listening to this conversation with much interest.    "And, if you will return to us our treasure, we will promise never to  steal again, but to remain honest men and enjoy our wealth in peace,"
