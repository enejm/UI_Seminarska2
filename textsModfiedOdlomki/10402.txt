"I think you've said enough, sir."    Bones was very red and very haughty.    "Far be it from me to resent your attitude or contradict your calumnies.  Miss Hamilton will see very little of me. An inflexible sense of duty  will keep me away from the frivolous circle of society, sir. Alert an'  sleepless----"    "Trenches," said Hamilton brutally.
