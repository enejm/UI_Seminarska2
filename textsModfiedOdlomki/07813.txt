Limousin, Perche, and Normandy; and this emulation would have been  beneficial to all. But the king is silent, and consequently I am  condemned."    During this speech, Louis was, unconsciously, folding and unfolding  Mazarinâ€™s paper, upon which he had not cast his eyes. At length he  glanced upon it, and uttered a faint cry at reading the first line.    "What is the matter, my son?" asked the queen, anxiously, and going  towards the king.    "From the cardinal," replied the king, continuing to read; "yes, yes, it  is really from him."    "Is he worse, then?"

"You must reply to it, my son," said Anne of Austria; "you must reply to  it, and immediately."    "But how, madame?"
