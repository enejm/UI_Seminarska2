Then Moa's bulk blocked the doorway. She faced me.    "Sit where you are, Gregg." She turned and closed the door upon us. "I  am not afraid of you. Should I be?"    "No," I said.    She came and sat down beside me. "If you should attempt to leave this  room, the stern look-out has orders to bore you through."    "I have no intention of leaving the room," I retorted.
