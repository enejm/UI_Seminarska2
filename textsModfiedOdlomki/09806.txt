   Like most creatures of the Wild, he early experienced famine.  There came  a time when not only did the meat-supply cease, but the milk no longer  came from his mother's breast.  At first, the cubs whimpered and cried,  but for the most part they slept.  It was not long before they were  reduced to a coma of hunger.  There were no more spats and squabbles, no  more tiny rages nor attempts at growling; while the adventures toward the  far white wall ceased altogether.  The cubs slept, while the life that  was in them flickered and died down.    One Eye was desperate.  He ranged far and wide, and slept but little in  the lair that had now become cheerless and miserable.  The she-wolf, too,  left her litter and went out in search of meat.  In the first days after  the birth of the cubs, One Eye had journeyed several times back to the  Indian camp and robbed the rabbit snares; but, with the melting of the  snow and the opening of the streams, the Indian camp had moved away, and  that source of supply was closed to him.    When the grey cub came back to life and again took interest in the far  white wall, he found that the population of his world had been reduced.  Only one sister remained to him.  The rest were gone.  As he grew  stronger, he found himself compelled to play alone, for the sister no  longer lifted her head nor moved about.  His little body rounded out with  the meat he now ate; but the food had come too late for her.  She slept  continuously, a tiny skeleton flung round with skin in which the flame  flickered lower and lower and at last went out.    Then there came a time when the grey cub no longer saw his father  appearing and disappearing in the wall nor lying down asleep in the  entrance.  This had happened at the end of a second and less severe  famine.  The she-wolf knew why One Eye never came back, but there was no  way by which she could tell what she had seen to the grey cub.
