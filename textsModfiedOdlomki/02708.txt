temperature of boiling water at a depth of less than a mile. The  center of the earth is roughly 4,000 miles below the surface.    "Because of this intense internal heat of the earth it would probably  be impossible to maintain permanent laboratories at greater depths  than two miles," said the lecturer, "and, in addition, the  installation and maintenance of Plutonic laboratories will be a  scientific adventure of great difficulty and expense. Yet, if carried  on in connection with the work of existing mines and borings it may  mark the coming decade as one of the important epochs in man's attempt  to understand the earth.    "These Plutonic laboratories, placed at various depths under the  surface, fully equipped with modern scientific apparatus, and  maintained indefinitely, will contribute to our knowledge in a dozen  important fields of geophysic and astronomy."    What Prof. Shapley pointed to as merely a possible by-product of the  proposed scientific "descent into Hades" is the commercial possibility  of tapping the earth's internal source of heat. There is 31,000,000  times as much natural heat in the earth than in all the coal resources  of the world. He stated that Sir Charles Parsons and John L. Hodgson,  both noted British engineers, are already engaged in work on this  problem.          When Caverns Yawned    _By Captain S. P. Meek_    [Illustration: From the bump on the side of the submarine came a flash  of red light.]    [Sidenote: Only Dr. Bird's super-scientific sleuthing stands in the  way of Ivan Saranoff's latest attempt at wholesale destruction.]      Bells jangled discordantly. A whistle split the air with a piercing  note. A band blared away on the platform. With a growing rumble of  sound, the Presidential special slowly gathered headway. The President  waved a final farewell to the crowds at the platform and sat down. He  chatted cheerily with his companions until the train was clear of  Charleston, then rose, and with a word to the others stepped into the  car. Operative Carnes of the United States Service slumped back in  his chair with a sigh of relief.
