  "Aren't you confusing things?" she said. "You're not in the observatory  now, Buster; this is the lab. I thought the red shift was the recession  of the distant galaxies ... whatever 'red' is."    "Quite right, Holmes. However, in this case, it's the recession of  the not-so-distant atoms. They are small-sized solar systems, too,  in a way, and when I say 'red' I mean something I can only infer  mathematically, because I'm not dealing with light in the ordinary  sense."    "You mean they're _receding_?"    "Only in this context," he said. "Motion is length over time; in this  case, it's length over hyper-time, so they're still here in the lab."    "I'm relieved to hear it," she said. "However, I should think they'd be  receding into tomorrow."    "They are, but into yesterday, and new ones from tomorrow are  continually coming in to take their place. It's like Fred Hoyle's  theory of the continuous birth of hydrogen."    "You're making me feel like my poor husband," Katherine said. "I  understand the necessity of hyper-time to describe the motion of  consciousness along time, but what's this got to do with the atoms?"    *       *       *       *       *    There was a knock at the door and Phil stood up, just as Doctor  Russell Chalmers Farley came in without waiting for an answer. Phil  and Katherine felt faintly embarrassed--there was scarcely any need to  knock on the door to the physics lab; it somehow suggested that the  door should be kept open when entertaining callers.    Doctor Farley was a handsome man of thirty-eight with a blond mustache  that gave him the look of a Kipling colonial officer.    "Ah, there you are, Katherine," he said cheerfully. "Hello, Kaufman.  How's the Research Magnificent?"    "It's beginning to show signs of life," Phil said. "I think I can  detect a sort of fetal pulse."    Doctor Farley blinked his pale eyelashes and smiled. He sat down at the
