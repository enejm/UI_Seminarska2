 taking advantage of such cover as the ground afforded.    Beside a charred pile of timbers the Abyssinians halted, and Tarzan,  sneaking close and concealing himself in nearby shrubbery, watched them  in wonderment.  He saw them digging up the earth, and he wondered if  they had hidden meat there in the past and now had come for it.  Then  he recalled how he had buried his pretty pebbles, and the suggestion  that had caused him to do it.  They were digging for the things the  blacks had buried here!    Presently he saw them uncover a dirty, yellow object, and he witnessed  the joy of Werper and of Abdul Mourak as the grimy object was exposed  to view.  One by one they unearthed many similar pieces, all of the  same uniform, dirty yellow, until a pile of them lay upon the ground, a  pile which Abdul Mourak fondled and petted in an ecstasy of greed.    Something stirred in the ape-man's mind as he looked long upon the  golden ingots.  Where had he seen such before?  What were they?  Why  did these Tarmangani covet them so greatly?  To whom did they belong?    He recalled the black men who had buried them.  The things must be  theirs.  Werper was stealing them as he had stolen Tarzan's pouch of  pebbles.  The ape-man's eyes blazed in anger.  He would like to find  the black men and lead them against these thieves.  He wondered where  their village might be.    As all these things ran through the active mind, a party of men moved  out of the forest at the edge of the plain and advanced toward the  ruins of the burned bungalow.    Abdul Mourak, always watchful, was the first to see them, but already  they were halfway across the open.  He called to his men to mount and  hold themselves in readiness, for in the heart of Africa who may know  whether a strange host be friend or foe?    Werper, swinging into his saddle, fastened his eyes upon the newcomers,  then, white and trembling he turned toward Abdul Mourak.
