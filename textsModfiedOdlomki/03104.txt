gangling and bulge-chested; sophisticated Taliuvenna of the flowing dark  hair and the lustrous eyes--no, to them Earth was only one more planet,  out of thousands they had seen in their long lives.    _And I'm a sentimental fool._      2    He could have willed the vague regret out of his trained nervous system,  but he didn't want to. This was the last time human eyes would ever look  on Earth, and somehow Jorun felt that it should be more to him than just  another psychotechnic job.    "Hello, good sir."    He turned at the voice and forced his tired lips into a friendly smile.  "Hello, Julith," he said. It was a wise policy to learn the names of the  townspeople, at least, and she was a great-great-granddaughter of the  Speaker.    She was some thirteen or fourteen years old, a freckle-faced child with  a shy smile, and steady green eyes. There was a certain awkward grace  about her, and she seemed more imaginative than most of her stolid race.  She curtsied quaintly for him, her bare foot reaching out under the long  smock which was daily female dress here.    "Are you busy, good sir?" she asked.    "Well, not too much," said Jorun. He was glad of a chance to talk; it  silenced his thoughts. "What can I do for you?"    "I wondered--" She hesitated, then, breathlessly: "I wonder if you could  give me a lift down to the beach? Only for an hour or two. It's too far  to walk there before I have to be home, and I can't borrow a car, or  even a horse. If it won't be any trouble, sir."    "Mmmm--shouldn't you be at home now? Isn't there milking and so on to  do?"    "Oh, I don't live on a farm, good sir. My father is a baker."    "Yes, yes, so he is. I should have remembered." Jorun considered for an  instant. There was enough to do in town, and it wasn't fair for him to  play hooky while Zarek worked alone. "Why do you want to go to the  beach, Julith?"
