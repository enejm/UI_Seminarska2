*       *       *       *       *    Judd saw the fear gnawing at their vitals. He felt it too. But there  seemed no immediate danger, so, with a ray-gun in each hand, he  summoned a blustering courage and said to the others, harshly:    "Yes, it was that damned Carse! He must have got loose in some way.  But pull yourselves together: we're safe here. He's somewhere  outside."    He reasoned it out for them.    "He couldn't have done that shooting from the _Star Devil_; it's too  far away. And he's not in it now or he'd be using it to try and find  that black of his--if the black's still alive. No, he's not in the  ship, and he's not in this house. He's somewhere outside, and he can't  reach us here while the phantis have the place surrounded. We can  shoot them down from the attic, and they'll soon beat it for the  jungle. When that happens we'll rush to the ships, and before Carse  knows what it's all about we'll be up and away and he'll be marooned.  Then we'll get him later."    His words brought a return of confidence. It was true, the others  thought: the Hawk could not reach them as long as the phantis were  around the house; and when they were driven away, the ships were near  at hand and empty. All they had to do was get to the ships before  Carse. The adventurer certainly was not then in one of the craft, or  he would be wasting no time hunting for Friday--and raying their  stronghold. No doubt he was up a tree somewhere; perhaps gored and  dead.    One of the men snickered, and Judd smiled at the sound. Their  confidence in him was encouraging.    "Get to the windows of the attic," he ordered. "Some of those crazy  brutes are horning at the house. We've got to shoot them and get out  of here, quick!"    *       *       *       *       *
