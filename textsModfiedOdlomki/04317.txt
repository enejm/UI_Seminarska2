I grab it, release the limbs and pull it as far back as the door. I  maneuver the stretcher on top and realize there is nothing to fasten  it with ... except the antigrav, I get that undone, holding the  stretcher in balance, and manage to put it under the stretcher and  pass the straps between the bars of the grid ... then round the little  boat, and the buckle just grips the last inch.
