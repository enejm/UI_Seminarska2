 me examine it.    "By means of certain fluorescent substances which I used, I found that  your pillow was being bathed in a flood of ultra-violet light, and the  fluoro-spectroscope soon told me that lunium emanations were present in  large quantities. These rays were not coming to you directly from their  source, but one of the windows of the State, War and Navy Building was  being used as a reflector. I located the approximate source of the ray  by means of an improvised apparatus, and we surrounded the place.  Stokowsky was killed while attempting to escape. I guess that is about  all there is to it."    "Thank you, Doctor," said the President. "I would be interested in a  description of the apparatus which he used to produce this effect."    *       *       *       *       *    "The apparatus was quite simple, Sir. It was merely a large collector of  moonlight, which was thrown after collection onto a lunium plate. The  resultant emanations were turned into a parallel beam by a parabolic  reflector and focused, through a rock crystal lens with an extremely  long focal length, onto your pillow."    "Then Stokowsky had isolated Von Beyer's new element?" asked the  President.    "I am still in doubt whether it is a new element or merely an allotropic  modification of the common element, cadmium. The plate which he used has  a very peculiar property. When moonlight, or any other reflected light  of the same composition falls on it, it acts on the ray much as the  button of a Roentgen tube acts on a cathode ray. As the cathode ray is  absorbed and an entirely new ray, the X-ray, is given off by the button,  just so is the reflected moonlight absorbed and a new ray of  ultra-violet given off. This is the ray which Von Beyer detected. I  thought that I could catch traces of Von Beyer's lines in my  spectroscope, and I think now that it is due to a trace of lunium in the
