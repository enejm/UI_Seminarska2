looked at me. "Has it any back yard, George?"    "How should I know?" I retorted. "Probably has."    "Go on," Alten was prompting.    "That is nearly all. I found a doorway leading to a dark room. I  crawled through it toward a glow of light. I passed through another  room. I thought I was in a nightmare, and that this was my home. I  remembered that the cage had not moved. It had hardly lurched. Just  trembled; vibrated.    "But this was not my home. The rooms were small and dark. Then I  peered through a window on a strange stone street. And saw these  strange-looking young men. And that is all--all I can tell you."    She had evidently held herself calm by a desperate effort. She broke  down now, sobbing without restraint.

A torrent in the midst of which we were caught up like tiny  bits of cork and whirled away.    But we thought we understood the mystery. We believed we were acting  for the best. What we did was no doubt ill-considered; but the human  mind is so far from omniscient! And this thing was so strange!    Alten said, "You have a right to be overwrought, Mistress Mary Atwood.  But this thing is as strange to us as it is to you. I called that iron  monster a Robot. But it does not belong to our age: if it does I have  never seen one such as you describe. And traveling through Time--"    He smiled down at her. "That is not a commonplace everyday occurrence  to us, I assure you. The difference is that in this world of ours we  can understand--or at least explain--these things as being scientific.  And so they have not the terror of the supernatural."    Mary was calmer now. She returned his smile. "I realize that; or at  least I am trying to realize it."
