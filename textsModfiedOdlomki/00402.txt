 "To be sure!" said Seseley, with sympathy.  "I never thought of fairy  life in that way before.  It must get to be quite tiresome."    "And think of the centuries I must yet live!" exclaimed the fairy in a  dismal voice.  "Isn't it an awful thing to look forward to?"    "It is, indeed," agreed Seseley.
