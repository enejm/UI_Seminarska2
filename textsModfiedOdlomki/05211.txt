unthinkable, something of dread, would be revealed. The voice went on:    "These brains I wanted were not many--only six in all. Most of them you  knew, Master Leithgow, these men who constituted the cream of Earth's  scientific ability. Professor Estapp, the good-looking young American;  Dr. Swanson, the Swede; Master Scientist Cram--the great English genius  Cram, already legendary, the only other of that rank beside yourself;  Professor Geinst, the hunchbacked, mysterious German; and Dr.  Norman--Dr. Sir Charles Esme Norman, to give him his English title. I  wanted these men, and I got them! All except you, the sixth!"    *      *      *      *      *    Again Dr. Ku Sui smiled in triumph. To Eliot Leithgow his smile was  unspeakable.    "Yes," the elderly scientist cried out, "you got them, you murderer!"    "Oh, no, no, Master Leithgow, you are mistaken. I did not kill them. Why  should I be stupid as to do that? To these men I wanted so badly? No,  no. Because these five scientists disappeared from Earth suddenly,  without trace, without hint of the manner of their going, the stupid  Earthlings believe they were killed! Stupid Earthlings! Abducted, of  course; but why assume they were killed? And why, of all people, decide  that Master Scientist Eliot Leithgow had something to do with their  disappearance? I confess to having planted that evidence pointing to  you, but if they had the sense of a turnip they would know that you were  incapable of squashing a flea, let alone destroying five eminent  brothers in science! You, jealous, guilty of five _crimes passionel!  Pour le science!_ Credulous Earthlings! Incredible Earthlings! And here  are you, a hunted man with a price on your head!    "So for ten years you have thought I murdered those five men? No, no.  They were very much alive for eight years and very troublesome  prisoners. It took me eight years to solve the problem I had set myself.
