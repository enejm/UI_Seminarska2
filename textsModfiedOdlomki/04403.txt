"Would I fool with them if they were big? They can't hurt you. They're  only about so long. I've got them in a cage."    They were in the barn now and Slim saw the large cage suspended from a  hook in the roof. It was covered with stiff canvas.    Red said, "We used to have some bird there or something. Anyway, they  can't get away from there. Come on, let's go up to the loft."    They clambered up the wooden stairs and Red hooked the cage toward them.    Slim pointed and said, "There's sort of a hole in the canvas."    Red frowned. "How'd that get there?" He lifted the canvas, looked in,  and said, with relief, "They're still there."    "The canvas appeared to be burned," worried Slim.    "You want to look, or don't you?"    Slim nodded slowly. He wasn't sure he wanted to, after all. They might  be--    But the canvas had been jerked off and there they were. Two of them, the  way Red said. They were small, and sort of disgusting-looking. The  animals moved quickly as the canvas lifted and were on the side toward  the youngsters. Red poked a cautious finger at them.    "Watch out," said Slim, in agony.    "They don't hurt you," said Red. "Ever see anything like them?"    "No."    "Can't you see how a circus would jump at a chance to have these?"    "Maybe they're too small for a circus."    Red looked annoyed. He let go the cage which swung back and forth  pendulum-fashion. "You're just trying to back out, aren't you?"    "No, I'm not. It's just--"    "They're not too small, don't worry. Right now, I've only got one  worry."    "What's that?"    "Well, I've got to keep them till the circus comes, don't I? I've got  to figure out what to feed them meanwhile."    The cage swung and the little trapped creatures clung to its bars,  gesturing at the youngsters with queer, quick motions--almost as though  they were intelligent.
