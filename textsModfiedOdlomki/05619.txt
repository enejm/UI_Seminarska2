the farther side.    Another respite. Another man through the hole. And but two  nitro-shells left!    *       *       *       *       *    The deadly circle, like wolves around a lone trapper who crouches  close to his dying fire, pressed in a little; and by their ominous  quietness, by the sight of their eyes all turned in on him, their  concerted inching closer, Ken sensed the nearness of the charge that  would finish him. All this in deep silence, there in the gloomy  quarter-light. He could not yell and brandish his fists at them as the  trapper by the fire might have done to win a few extra minutes. The  only cards he had to play were two shells--and one was needed now!    He fired it with deliberate, sure aim, and grunted as he saw its  victim convulse and die, with dark blood streaming. Again the swarm  hesitated.    Ken risked a glance above. Only three men left, he saw; and one was  pulled through the hole as he watched. Below, in one place, several  seal-creatures surged upward.    "Get back, damn you!" he cursed harshly. "All right--take it! That's  the last!"    And the last shell hissed out from the gun even as the last man,  above, was pulled through up into the air and safety.    Ken felt that he had given half his life with that final shell.  Completely surrounded by a hundred or more of the sealmen, he could  not possibly hope to maneuver the torpoon up to the hole in the ice  and leave it, without being overwhelmed. He had held off the swarm  long enough for the others to escape, but for himself it was the end.    So he thought, and wondered just when that end would come. Soon, he  knew. It would not take them long to overcome their fear when they saw  that he no longer reached out and struck them down in sudden bloody  death. Now it was their turn.
