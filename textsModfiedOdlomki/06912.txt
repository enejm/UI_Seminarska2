  Then he continued digging until he had unearthed the chest.  This also  he dragged to the side of the corpse.  Then he filled in the smaller  hole below the grave, replaced the body and the earth around and above  it, covered it over with underbrush, and returned to the chest.    Four sailors had sweated beneath the burden of its weight--Tarzan of  the Apes picked it up as though it had been an empty packing case, and  with the spade slung to his back by a piece of rope, carried it off  into the densest part of the jungle.    He could not well negotiate the trees with his awkward burden, but he  kept to the trails, and so made fairly good time.    For several hours he traveled a little north of east until he came to  an impenetrable wall of matted and tangled vegetation.  Then he took to  the lower branches, and in another fifteen minutes he emerged into the  amphitheater of the apes, where they met in council, or to celebrate  the rites of the Dum-Dum.    Near the center of the clearing, and not far from the drum, or altar,  he commenced to dig.  This was harder work than turning up the freshly  excavated earth at the grave, but Tarzan of the Apes was persevering  and so he kept at his labor until he was rewarded by seeing a hole  sufficiently deep to receive the chest and effectually hide it from  view.

But the heavy lock and massive iron bands baffled both his cunning and
