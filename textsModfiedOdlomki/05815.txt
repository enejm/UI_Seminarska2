ship. Her tiny white teeth and tiny yellow claws were harder than steel;  and she was, I knew, unbelievably strong for her size. If she got  suspicious or decided to throw a phobic tizzy, she could scatter shreds  of me over a square acre of Vesta in less time than it would take me to  yelp.    "Will you--" she began again.    I tried shakily, "Hell, no. Wait here." Then I had to translate it.    *       *       *       *       *    I went back to the _Lucky Pierre_ and got Yurt.

"What--do I do now?" she whispered worriedly.
