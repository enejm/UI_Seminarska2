amphibian and brought it and Paula on to the city. Bell, from the  shore, was seen to be investigating the larger one. He came rowing  back.    His head appeared above the dock edge.    "All right," he said tiredly. "The Master has a rule requiring all his  ships ready for instant flight. Very useful. The big plane is fueled  and full of oil. We'll go out to it and take off."    *       *       *       *       *    Jamison lifted The Master to his feet and with a surge of muscles  swept him down to the flooring of the dock.    "Paula first," said Bell, "and then The Master, and then you,  Jamison."    "One moment," said The Master reproachfully. "It would be cruel not to  let me reassure my subjects. I will give an order."    Bell and Jamison listened suspiciously. But he spoke gently to the  coachman.    "You will tell the deputies," said The Master in Spanish, "that a  month's supply of medicine for all my subjects will be found in my  laboratory. And you may tell them that I shall return before the end  of that time."    The coachman's eyes filled with a passionate relief.    "Now," said The Master placidly, "I am ready for our little jaunt."    Paula descended the ladder and seated herself in the bow of the boat.  Bell covered The Master grimly with his automatic as he descended,  with surprising agility. Jamison came down last, and resumed his  former grip on The Master's collar. Bell rowed out to the big plane.    *       *       *       *       *    Jamison kept close watch while Bell started the four huge motors and  throttled them down to warming up speed, and while he hauled up the  anchor with which the huge seaplane was anchored.
