 cat, and then came down on all four feet as it ambled out on the sand  and extended into the lapping river a tremendous beak studded with  teeth. A smell of crushed weeds and the musty odor like that of a lion  house filled the night. The tyranosaur--it was more like a tyranosaur  than anything else--breathed heavily and guzzled in great mouthfuls of  water.    Kirby sat perfectly still. He hoped the thing would go away. But the  tyranosaur did not go away. All at once it hissed loudly and stood up,  its eyes glowing green and baleful, and Kirby leaned forward.    From the water was slithering another creature with a gigantic,  quivering, jelly body. Kirby saw to his horror that, in addition to four  short legs with webbed, claw-tipped feet, there sprouted from the body a  number of octopus tentacles. From the scabrous mottle of the head,  cruel, unintelligent, bestial eyes glared at the rearing tyranosaur.    *       *       *       *       *    One of the serpentine tentacles whipped out, slapped against the  tyranosaur's fore-shoulder to call forth a hiss and a short bellow. Then  other tentacles waved in the moonlight, and in a flash the tyranosaur  was enmeshed as by a score of slimy cables. He was not altogether  helpless. Suddenly the steam shovel of a beak buried itself in the jelly  body of the water animal, and there spurted out a flood of inky liquid.  The water animal emitted a sickening gurgle. But the tyranosaur's  advantage was only temporary. Closer and closer drew the ugly, scabrous  tentacles. The tyranosaur never had a chance. Its green eyes flared, the  shovel beak plunged and slashed, but never for a second did the  tentacles relax. As Kirby stared, he saw the water animal begin to back  up, dragging its gigantic enemy with it. For a second the whole night  was hideous with the sound of hisses, gurgles, dashing water. Then the  river boiled once and for all, and both animals sank in its depths.
