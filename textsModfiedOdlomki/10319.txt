  So Bones' visit was fruitless.    He dismissed the palaver and walked back to his ship, and worked the  river, village by village, with no more satisfactory result. That night  in the little town of M'fa there was a dance and a jubilation to  celebrate the cunning of a people who had outwitted and overawed the  lords of the land, but the next day came Bosambo, who had established a  system of espionage more far-reaching, and possibly more effective, than  the service which the Government had instituted.    Liberties they might take with Bones; but they sat discomforted in  palaver before this alien chief, swathed in monkey tails, his shield in  one hand, and his bunch of spears in the other.    "All things I know," said Bosambo, when they told him what they had to  tell, "and it has come to me that you have spoken lightly of Tibbetti,  who is my friend and my master, and is well beloved of Sandi. Also they  tell me that you smiled at him. Now I tell you there will come a day  when you will not smile, and that day is near at hand."    "Lord," said the chief, "he made with us a foolish palaver, believing  that we had put away B'chumbiri."    "And he shall return to that foolish palaver," said Bosambo grimly, "and  if he goes away unsatisfied, behold I will come, and I will take your  old men, and I will hang them by hooks into a tree and roast their feet.  For if there is no Sandi and no law, behold I am Sandi and I law, doing  the will of a certain bearded king, Togi-tani."    He left the village of M'fa a little unhappy for the space of a day,  when, native-like, they forgot all that he had said.    In the meantime, up and down the river went Bones, palavers which lasted  from sunrise to sunset being his portion.    He had in his mind one vital fact, that for the honour of his race and  for the credit of his administration he must bring to justice the man  who slew the thing which he had found in the river.
