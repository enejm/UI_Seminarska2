I opened my lips, to offer a contradictory opinion; for my sense of the  saneness of things, would not allow me to take the story literally; then  I shut them again, without saying anything. Somehow, the certainty in  Tonnison's voice affected my doubts. I felt, all at once, less assured;  though I was by no means convinced as yet.    After a few moments' silence, Tonnison rose, stiffly, and began to  undress. He seemed disinclined to talk; so I said nothing; but followed  his example. I was weary; though still full of the story I had  just read.    Somehow, as I rolled into my blankets, there crept into my mind a memory  of the old gardens, as we had seen them.
