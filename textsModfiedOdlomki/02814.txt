  Mater paled with shock. Pater gave his spawn a scalding, scandalized  look. "You'll learn! You can't beat Biology," he said thickly,  creditably keeping his voice down. "Junior, you may go!"    Junior bobbled off, and Pater admonished Mater sternly, "We must have  patience, my dear! All children pass through these larval stages...."    "Yes, dear," sighed Mater.    *       *       *       *       *    At long last, Junior seemed to have resigned himself to making the best  of it.    With considerable exertions, hampered by his increasing  bottom-heaviness, he was fetching loads of stones, seaweed and other  debris to a spot downslope, and there laboring over what promised to  be a fairly ambitious cairn. Judging by what they could see of it,  his homesite might even prove a credit to the colony (so went Pater's  thoughts) and attract a mate who would be a good catch (thus Mater  mused).    Junior was still to be seen at times along the reef in company with  his free-swimming friends among the other polyps, at some of whom  his parents had always looked askance, fearing they were by no means  well-bred. In fact, there was strong suspicion that some of them--waifs  from the disreputable Shallows district in the hazardous reaches just  below the tide-mark--had never been bred at all, but were products of  budding, a practice frowned on in polite society.    However, Junior's appearance and rate of locomotion made it clear  he would soon be done with juvenile follies. As Pater repeated with  satisfaction--you can't beat Biology; as one becomes more and more  bottle-shaped, the romantic illusions of youth must inevitably perish.    "I always knew there was sound stuff in the youngster," declared Pater  expansively.    "At least he won't be able to go around with those ragamuffins much  longer," breathed Mater thankfully.    "What does the young fool think he's doing, fiddling round with  soapstone?" grumbled Pater, peering critically through the green to try
