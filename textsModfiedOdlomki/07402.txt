toward the wharf and along it until across the water they saw a small  boat just pulling into the shadows of a near-by steamer.    "There they be," whispered the man.    "Ten pounds if you will find a boat and row me to that steamer," cried  the woman.    "Quick, then," he replied, "for we gotta go it if we're goin' to catch  the Kincaid afore she sails.  She's had steam up for three hours an'  jest been a-waitin' fer that one passenger.   I was a-talkin' to one of  her crew 'arf an hour ago."    As he spoke he led the way to the end of the wharf where he knew  another boat lay moored, and, lowering the woman into it, he jumped in  after and pushed off.  The two were soon scudding over the water.    At the steamer's side the man demanded his pay and, without waiting to  count out the exact amount, the woman thrust a handful of bank-notes  into his outstretched hand.  A single glance at them convinced the  fellow that he had been more than well paid.  Then he assisted her up  the ladder, holding his skiff close to the ship's side against the  chance that this profitable passenger might wish to be taken ashore  later.    But presently the sound of the donkey engine and the rattle of a steel  cable on the hoisting-drum proclaimed the fact that the Kincaid's  anchor was being raised, and a moment later the waiter heard the  propellers revolving, and slowly the little steamer moved away from him  out into the channel.    As he turned to row back to shore he heard a woman's shriek from the  ship's deck.    "That's wot I calls rotten luck," he soliloquized.  "I might jest as  well of 'ad the whole bloomin' wad."      When Jane Clayton climbed to the deck of the Kincaid she found the ship  apparently deserted.  There was no sign of those she sought nor of any  other aboard, and so she went about her search for her husband and the  child she hoped against hope to find there without interruption.
