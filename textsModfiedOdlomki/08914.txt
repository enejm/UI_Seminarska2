wrapping the fair form of nature as in a silver bridal veil through  which her beauty shone mysteriously.    Stella looked down the terraced valley; she turned and looked up at the  scarred face of the golden moon, and then she looked at me. The beauty  of the night was about her face, the scent of the night was on her hair,  the mystery of the night shone in her shadowed eyes. She looked at me, I  looked on her, and all our hearts’ love blossomed within us. We spoke no  word--we had no words to speak, but slowly we drew near, till lips were  pressed to lips as we kissed our eternal troth.    It was she who broke that holy silence, speaking in a changed voice,  in soft deep notes that thrilled me like the lowest chords of a smitten  harp.    “Ah, now I understand,” she said, “now I know why we are lonely, and how  we can lose our loneliness. Now I know what it is that stirs us in the  beauty of the sky, in the sound of water and in the scent of flowers.  It is Love who speaks in everything, though till we hear his voice we  understand nothing. But when we hear, then the riddle is answered and  the gates of our heart are opened, and, Allan, we see the way that wends  through death to heaven, and is lost in the glory of which our love is  but a shadow.    “Let us go in, Allan. Let us go before the spell breaks, so that  whatever overtakes us, sorrow, death, or separation, we may always have  this perfect memory to save us. Come, dearest, let us go!”    I rose like a man in a dream, still holding her by the hand. But as I  rose my eye fell upon something that gleamed white among the foliage  of the orange bush at my side. I said nothing, but looked. The breeze  stirred the orange leaves, the moonlight struck for a moment full upon  the white object.    It was the face of Hendrika, the Babyan-woman, as Indaba-zimbi had  called her, and on it was a glare of hate that made me shudder.
