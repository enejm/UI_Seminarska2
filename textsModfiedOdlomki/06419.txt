I must perish miserably by degrees, shut in the heart of a hill, though  my friends were out for rescue.  In place of my former lethargy I was  now in a fever of unrest.    My first care was to explore the way I had come.  I ran down the  passage to the chasm which the slab of stone had spanned. I had been  right in my guess, for the thing was gone.
