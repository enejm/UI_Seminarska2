victim, forgot caution and locality.  When he remembered locality, it was  too late.  Dashing at top speed around a tepee, he ran full tilt into  Kiche lying at the end of her stick.  He gave one yelp of consternation,  and then her punishing jaws closed upon him.  She was tied, but he could  not get away from her easily.  She rolled him off his legs so that he  could not run, while she repeatedly ripped and slashed him with her  fangs.    When at last he succeeded in rolling clear of her, he crawled to his  feet, badly dishevelled, hurt both in body and in spirit.  His hair was  standing out all over him in tufts where her teeth had mauled.  He stood  where he had arisen, opened his mouth, and broke out the long,  heart-broken puppy wail.  But even this he was not allowed to complete.  In the middle of it, White Fang, rushing in, sank his teeth into  Lip-lip's hind leg.  There was no fight left in Lip-lip, and he ran away  shamelessly, his victim hot on his heels and worrying him all the way  back to his own tepee.  Here the squaws came to his aid, and White Fang,  transformed into a raging demon, was finally driven off only by a  fusillade of stones.    Came the day when Grey Beaver, deciding that the liability of her running  away was past, released Kiche.  White Fang was delighted with his  mother's freedom.  He accompanied her joyfully about the camp; and, so  long as he remained close by her side, Lip-lip kept a respectful  distance.  White Fang even bristled up to him and walked stiff-legged,  but Lip-lip ignored the challenge.  He was no fool himself, and whatever  vengeance he desired to wreak, he could wait until he caught White Fang  alone.    Later on that day, Kiche and White Fang strayed into the edge of the  woods next to the camp.  He had led his mother there, step by step, and  now when she stopped, he tried to inveigle her farther.  The stream, the  lair, and the quiet woods were calling to him, and he wanted her to come.
