sleeping place might be, nor, for patent reasons, was it desirable  that I should disturb the house and so create talk. In this dilemma I  remembered that Lord Ragnall’s confidential servant, Mr. Savage, when he  conducted me to my room on the previous night, which he made a point of  doing perhaps because he wished to talk over the matter of the snakes  that had found their way into his pockets, had shown me a bell in it  which he said rang outside his door. He called it an “emergency bell.” I  remarked idly that it was improbable that I should have any occasion for  its use.    “Who knows, sir?” said Mr. Savage prophetically. “There are folk who say  that this old castle is haunted, which after what I have seen to-night  I can well believe. If you should chance to meet a ghost looking, let us  say, like those black villains, Harum and Scarum, or whatever they call  themselves--well, sir, two’s better company than one.”    I considered that bell but was loath to ring it for the reasons I have  given. Then I went outside the room and looked. As I had hoped might be  the case, there ran the wire on the face of the wall connected along its  length by other wires with the various rooms it passed.    I set to work and followed that wire. It was not an easy job; indeed  once or twice it reminded me of that story of the old Greek hero who  found his way through a labyrinth by means of a silken thread. I forget  whether it were a bull or a lady he was looking for, but with care and  perseverance he found one or the other, or it may have been both.    Down staircases and various passages I went with my eye glued upon the  wire, which occasionally got mixed up with other wires, till at length  it led me through a swing door covered with red baize into what appeared  to be a modern annexe to the castle. Here at last it terminated on  the spring of an alarming-looking and deep-throated bell that hung  immediately over a certain door.
