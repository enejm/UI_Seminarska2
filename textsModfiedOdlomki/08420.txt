 stones; now ye would go to Natal and across the moving black water and  sell them, and be rich, as it is the desire of a white man's heart to  be. Cursed for your sake be the white stones, and cursed he who seeks  them. Death shall it be to him who sets foot in the place of Death to  find them. I have spoken. White men, ye can go."
