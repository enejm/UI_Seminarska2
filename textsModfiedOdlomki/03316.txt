And then, for just a moment, there came the notion of yielding. _You  love the girl, Conru. You love her so much it's a pain in you. Well,  take her! Marry her!_    No. I was not excessively tender of heart or conscience, but neither  was I that kind of scoundrel.    I kissed her words away. Afterward, alone in the darkness of my room,  I realized that Conrad Haugen had no good reason to hang back. It was  true, all she said was true, and no other couple was waiting for an  uncertain future.    It was the time for action.    *       *       *       *       *    I had been ready for days now, postponing the moment. And those days  were marching to the time of war, the rebels were quivering to go, a  scant few weeks at most lay between me and the ruin of Valgolian plans  and work and hope.    In my steadily expanding official capacity, I could go anywhere and do  almost anything in an engineering line. So, bit by bit, I had tinkered  with the base's general alarm system.    We had scoutships posted, of course, but by the very nature of things  they had to be close to the planet or an approaching enemy would slip  between them without detection. And the substantial vibrations of  a ship traveling faster than light do not arrive much ahead of the  ship itself. Whatever warning we had of a hypothetical assault would  be very short. It would be signaled to all of us by a siren on the  intercommunications system, and after that it would be battle stations,  naval units to their ships and all others to such ground defenses as we  had.    But modern warfare is all to the offense. There is no way of stopping  an attack from space except by meeting it and annihilating it before  it gets to its destination. The rebels were counting on that fact to  aid them when they struck, but it would, of course, work against them
