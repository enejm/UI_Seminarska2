  "You may need them, some time," he said, "and there is really no use in  my manufacturing these things unless somebody uses them."    "Why did you leave the surface of the earth?" enquired the Wizard.    "I could not help it. It is a sad story, but if you will try to restrain  your tears I will tell you about it. On earth I was a manufacturer of  Imported Holes for American Swiss Cheese, and I will acknowledge that I  supplied a superior article, which was in great demand.
