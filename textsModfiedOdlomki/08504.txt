and I have its skin upon my bed. Look there!’ she went on in an altered  voice, touching me on the arm and pointing to some far-away object, ‘I  said just now that I had companions; there is one of them.’    I looked, and for the first time there burst upon my sight the glory of  Mount Kenia. Hitherto the mountain had always been hidden in mist, but  now its radiant beauty was unveiled for many thousand feet, although  the base was still wrapped in vapour so that the lofty peak or pillar,  towering nearly twenty thousand feet into the sky, appeared to be a  fairy vision, hanging between earth and heaven, and based upon the  clouds. The solemn majesty and beauty of this white peak are together  beyond the power of my poor pen to describe. There it rose straight and  sheer--a glittering white glory, its crest piercing the very blue of  heaven. As I gazed at it with that little girl I felt my whole heart  lifted up with an indescribable emotion, and for a moment great and  wonderful thoughts seemed to break upon my mind, even as the arrows of  the setting sun were breaking upon Kenia’s snows. Mr Mackenzie’s natives  call the mountain the ‘Finger of God’, and to me it did seem eloquent  of immortal peace and of the pure high calm that surely lies above this  fevered world. Somewhere I had heard a line of poetry,    A thing of beauty is a joy for ever,    and now it came into my mind, and for the first time I thoroughly  understood what it meant. Base, indeed, would be the man who could look  upon that mighty snow-wreathed pile--that white old tombstone of the  years--and not feel his own utter insignificance, and, by whatever name  he calls Him, worship God in his heart. Such sights are like visions of  the spirit; they throw wide the windows of the chamber of our small  selfishness and let in a breath of that air that rushes round the  rolling spheres, and for a while illumine our darkness with a far-off  gleam of the white light which beats upon the Throne.
