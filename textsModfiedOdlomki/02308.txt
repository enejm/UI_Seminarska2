livid lines of healing cuts and bruises.    McGuire tried gingerly to move his arms and legs; they were still  functioning though stiff and weak from disuse. He raised himself  slowly and stood swaying on his feet, then made his uncertain way to  his companion and shook him weakly by the shoulder.    Professor Sykes breathed deeply and raised leaden lids from tired eyes  to stare uncomprehendingly at McGuire. Soon his dark pupils ceased to  dilate, and he, too, could see their prison and the light of day.    "Sunlight!" he said in a thin voice, and he seemed to know now that  they were in the air; "I wonder--I wonder--if we shall land--what  country? ...

The cloud bank  was deep, and they felt the craft under them sink slowly, steadily  into the misty embrace. It thinned below them to drifting vapor, and  the first hazy shadows of the ground showed through from far beneath.
