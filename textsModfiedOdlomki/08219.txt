really liked Elzevir, and partly that they might have a sailor in the  boat to direct them; but the others cast off and left us with a curse,  saying that we might go and drown for obstinate Englishmen.    So we two were left alone on the brig, which kept drifting backwards  slowly; but the pinnace was soon lost to sight, though we saw that they  were rowing wild as soon as she passed out of the shelter of the ship,  and that they had much ado to keep her head to the sea.    Then Elzevir went to the kicking-wheel, and beckoned me to help him, and  between us we put the helm hard up. I saw then that he had given up all  hope of the wind shifting, and was trying to run her dead for the beach.
