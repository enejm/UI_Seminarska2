  "The gun in your belt," he said, "--drop it. Right on the floor.  There--better. I like you not with a gun near your hand, Carse."    The Hawk regarded him frigidly.    "And now what?" he asked.    Lar Tantril continued smiling. His ray-gun did not move for an instant  from the line it held on the metal and fabric giant. He said at a  tangent, quite pleasantly:    "Think fast, Captain Carse--think fast! Isn't that one of Dr. Ku's new  suits?--a little space-ship all your own? Why not plan a sudden sweep  for that door in an attempt to crash through my men and get free up in  the air--eh?"    "Why not?" said the Hawk.    "It might be possible," Tantril continued, "with your luck. _Unless  something went wrong with your helmet gravity-plates._"    At this the Venusian's gun moved. Deliberately it came up and aimed at  the crown of the adventurer's helmet. Tantril squeezed the trigger.    _Spang!_    A pencil-thin streak of orange stabbed between Venusian and Earthling;  sparks hissed out where it struck the tip of the helmet; and for an  instant life and strength seemed to leave the grotesquely clad figure.  Carse slumped down under a quick crushing weight. Weight! It bent him  low, and it was only with a great effort that he was able to  straighten again. For the suit's full load of metal and fabric was  upon him now, its enormous boots binding him to the ground since their  weight was unrelieved by the partial lift of the helmet plates. An  inch-wide, black-rimmed hole in the mechanism above the helmet told  what had happened.    Lar Tantril chortled, and his men, most of them only half  comprehending what he had done, echoed him.    "But even yet you've got a chance," the Venusian went on. "There's  another set of plates in the boot-soles, for attraction. If you got a  chance to stand on your head outside, you'd be gone! So--"    *       *       *       *       *
