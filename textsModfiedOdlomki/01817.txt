He repeated, it seemed, a command, congratulation, to judge by the  ecstasy of the figure below. The warrior turned once to throw himself  before the image of the sun; he repeated this again and yet again  before he crept back to his fellows. The group arose and rushed  swiftly toward the bound man.    They brought him quickly into the presence. With scant ceremony Jerry  was unrolled from the net; he lay free and gasping upon the floor. The  men scurried like mad from out the pathway of light that shone down  from the false sun. Jerry rose to his feet; the brilliance before him  almost blinded, but he saw now whence it came.    There was a hollow in the wall, a great parabola, deep and wide, and  it was lined throughout with beaten gold.
