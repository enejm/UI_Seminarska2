"Do we look like an army of conquest?"    "No," said the first giant who had spoken, "you look like innocent  tramps; but you never can tell by appearances.  Wait here until we  report to our masters.  No one can enter here without the permission of  Vig, the Czarover."    "Who's that?" inquired Dorothy.    But the heads had all bobbed down and disappeared behind the walls, so  there was no answer.  They waited a long time before the gate rolled  back with a rumbling sound, and a loud voice cried, "Enter!"  But they  lost no time in taking advantage of the invitation.    On either side of the broad street that led into the city from the gate  stood a row of huge giants, twenty of them on a side and all standing  so close together that their elbows touched.  They wore uniforms of  blue and yellow and were armed with clubs as big around as treetrunks.  Each giant had around his neck a broad band of gold, riveted on, to  show he was a slave.    As our friends entered riding upon the Lion, the Woozy, the Sawhorse  and the Mule, the giants half turned and walked in two files on either  side of them, as if escorting them on their way.  It looked to Dorothy  as if all her party had been made prisoners, for even mounted on their  animals their heads scarcely reached to the knees of the marching  giants.  The girls and Button-Bright were anxious to know what sort of  a city they had entered, and what the people were like who had made  these powerful creatures their slaves.  Through the legs of the giants  as they walked, Dorothy could see rows of houses on each side of the  street and throngs of people standing on the sidewalks, but the people  were of ordinary size and the only remarkable thing about them was the  fact that they were dreadfully lean and thin.  Between their skin and  their bones there seemed to be little or no flesh, and they were mostly  stoop-shouldered and weary looking, even to the little children.
