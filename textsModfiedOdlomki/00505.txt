the top of the flight five stairs leading straight down again. Again  the passage turned abruptly, this time to the left, and ten more stairs  led upward.    The passage was now quite dark, for they were in the heart of the  mountain and all daylight had been shut out by the turns of the  passage. However, Ozma drew her silver wand from her bosom and the  great jewel at its end gave out a lustrous, green-tinted light which  lighted the place well enough for them to see their way plainly.    Ten steps up, five steps down, and a turn, this way or that. That was  the program, and Dorothy figured that they were only gaining five  stairs upward each trip that they made.    "Those Flatheads must be funny people," she said to Ozma. "They don't  seem to do anything in a bold straightforward manner. In making this  passage they forced everyone to walk three times as far as is  necessary. And of course this trip is just as tiresome to the Flatheads  as it is to other folks."    "That is true," answered Ozma; "yet it is a clever arrangement to  prevent their being surprised by intruders. Every time we reach the  tenth step of a flight, the pressure of our feet on the stone makes a  bell ring on top of the mountain, to warn the Flatheads of our coming."    "How do you know that?" demanded Dorothy, astonished.    "I've heard the bell ever since we started," Ozma told her.

"I'd thought we were going to  visit just common, ordinary people," she remarked, "but they're pretty  clever, it seems, and they know some kinds of magic, too. They may be
