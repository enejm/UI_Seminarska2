 longings? You dreamed that you were alone in the vast universe. Well, is  not every living creature thus alone? You dreamed that the shadowy shape  of Ayesha came to you. Has it ever left your side? You dreamed that she  led you over sea and land, past places haunted by your memory, above the  mysterious mountains of the Unknown to an undiscovered peak. Does she  not thus lead you through life to that peak which lies beyond the Gates  of Death? You dreamed----”    “Oh! no more of it,” he exclaimed. “What I saw, I saw, and that I shall  follow. Think as you will, Horace, and do what you will. To-morrow I  start for India, with you if you choose to come; if not, without you.”    “You speak roughly, Leo,” I said. “You forget that _I_ have had no sign,  and that the nightmare of a man so near to insanity that but a few hours  ago he was determined upon suicide, will be a poor staff to lean on when  we are perishing in the snows of Central Asia. A mixed vision, this of  yours, Leo, with its mountain peak shaped like a _crux-ansata_ and the  rest. Do you suggest that Ayesha is re-incarnated in Central Asia--as a  female Grand Lama or something of that sort?”    “I never thought of it, but why not?” asked Leo quietly. “Do you  remember a certain scene in the Caves of Kor yonder, when the living  looked upon the dead, and dead and living were the same? And do you  remember what Ayesha swore, that she would come again--yes, to this  world; and how could that be except by re-birth, or, what is the same  thing, by the transmigration of the spirit?”    I did not answer this argument. I was struggling with myself.    “No sign has come to me,” I said, “and yet I have had a part in the  play, humble enough, I admit, and I believe that I have still a part.”    “No,” he said, “no sign has come to you. I wish that it had. Oh! how I  wish you could be convinced as I am, Horace!”
