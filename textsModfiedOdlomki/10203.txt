  "Now we will kill the king of the Isisi, and the white man also." The  voice was the chief's, but Sanders was not taking any particular  interest in the conversation, because there was a hive of wild bees  buzzing in his head, and a maze of pain; he felt sick.    "If you kill me it is little matter," said the king's voice, "because  there are many men who can take my place; but if you slay Sandi, you  slay the father of the people, and none can replace him."    "He whipped you, little king," said the chief of the Akasava mockingly.    "I would throw him into the river," said a strange voice after a long  interval; "thus shall no trace be found of him, and no man will lay his  death to our door."    "What of the king?" said another. Then came a crackling of twigs and the  voices of men.    "They are searching," whispered a voice. "King, if you speak I will kill  you now."    "Kill!" said the young king's even voice, and shouted, "Oh, M'sabo!  Beteli! Sandi is here!"    That was all Sandi heard.    *     *     *     *     *    Two days later he sat up in bed and demanded information. There was a  young doctor with him when he woke, who had providentially arrived from  headquarters.    "The king?" he hesitated. "Well, they finished the king, but he saved  your life. I suppose you know that?"    Sanders said "Yes" without emotion.    "A plucky little beggar," suggested the doctor.    "Very," said Sanders. Then: "Did they catch the chief of the Akasava?"    "Yes; he was so keen on finishing you that he delayed his bolting. The  king threw himself on you and covered your body."    "That will do."    Sanders' voice was harsh and his manner brusque at the best of times,  but now his rudeness was brutal.    "Just go out of the hut, doctor--I want to sleep."
