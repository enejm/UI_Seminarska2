 “Therefore, merciful Mother that bore me, to thee I make my prayer.  Oh, let his true love atone my sin; or, if it may not be, then give me  death, the last and most blessed of thy boons!”        CHAPTER XVI    THE CHANGE    She ceased, and there was a long, long silence. Leo and I looked at  each other in dismay. We had hoped against hope that this beautiful  and piteous prayer, addressed apparently to the great, dumb spirit of  Nature, would be answered. That meant a miracle, but what of it? The  prolongation of the life of Ayesha was a miracle, though it is true that  some humble reptiles are said to live as long as she had done.

Such thoughts as these rose in our minds as the endless minutes were  born and died and--nothing happened.    Yes, at last one thing did happen. The light from the sheet of flame
