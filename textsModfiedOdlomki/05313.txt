suspicion. Lar Tantril had good reasons for maintaining a constant  watch over his stronghold, and his guards' eyes were sharpened by  knowledge of the severe payment laxness would bring. Close at hand in  the platforms were knobs which, pressed, would ring a clanging alarm  through all the buildings below; and each guard wore two ray-gun  holsters.    Despite the guards and the ugly spikes of the fence, however, the  ranch from above appeared peaceful, calm and harmless. No men were  visible on its shadow-dappled clearing. Even the surrounding jungle,  in the watch-beacon's shaded underside, might have been nothing but a  stage set, were it not for the occasional signs of the life that crept  unseen through it--a long, far-distant howl, a quickly receding  crashing in the undergrowth, a thumping from some small animal.    The guards were used to this pattern of nocturnal sounds. It was only  when, from a tree not thirty feet from one of the platforms, there  came a sudden sharp shaking in the upper branches, that the Venusian  on that platform deigned to grip his ray-gun and peer suspiciously.  All he saw was a large bird that flapped out and winged across the  clearing, mewing angrily.    The guard released his grip on the gun. A snake, probably, had  disturbed the bird. Or some of those devilish little crimson bansis,  half insect, half crab....    *       *       *       *       *    Hawk Carse breathed again. He had been sure his position would be  revealed when, drifting with almost imperceptible motion into the  tree, the bird had pecked at him, then flapped away in alarm. A long,  painfully cautious approach from tree to tree to the selected one had  been necessary to the daring scheme of attack he had evolved.    He seemed to be safe. Through a fringe of leaves he saw the guard on  the platform glancing elsewhere. Carse steadied himself, rose slightly  and again scanned the ranch.    Yes, it looked harmless, but he knew that nothing could be further
