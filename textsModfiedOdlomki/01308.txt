charts of the human body with the arterial system outlined. But when he  dressed again and put on his jaunty captain's uniform, only the  electrode clamped to his head and the thin wires dangling from it in the  back were visible to disclose that there was anything unusual about him.    He said smilingly, "Don't stare at me like that."    I took a grip on myself. This thing was frightening, now that I actually  was embarked on it. Derek had explained to me briefly the workings of  his apparatus. A vibratory electronic current, for which as yet he had  no name, was stored in the small battery. He had said:    "There's nothing incomprehensible about this, Charlie. It's merely a  changing of the vibration rate of the basic substance out of which our  bodies are made. Vibration is the governing factor of all states of  matter. In its essence what we call substance is wholly intangible. That  is already proven. A vortex! A whirlpool of nothingness! It creates a  pseudo-substance which is the only material in the universe. And from  this, by vibration, is built the complicated structure of things as we  see and feel them to be, all dependent upon vibration. Everything is  altered, directly as the vibratory rate is changed. From the most  tenuous gas, to fluids to solids--throughout all the different states of  matter the only fundamental difference is the rate of vibration."    *       *       *       *       *    I understood the basic principle of this that he was explaining--that  now when this electronic current which he had captured and controlled  was applied to our physical body, the vibration rate of every smallest  and most minute particle of our physical being was altered. There is so  little in the vast scale of natural phenomena of which our human senses  are cognisant! Our eyes see the colors of the spectrum, from red to  violet. But a vast invisible world of color lies below the red of the  rainbow! Physicists call it the infra-red. And beyond the violet,
