Creighton--to make anyone do anything he wants.  And that is three  years ago.  I have taught him a good deal since, Colonel Creighton.  I  think you waste him now.'    'Hmm!  Maybe you're right.  But, as you know, there is no Survey work  for him at present.'    'Let him out let him go,' Mahbub interrupted.  'Who expects any colt to  carry heavy weight at first?  Let him run with the caravans--like our  white camel-colts--for luck.  I would take him myself, but--'    'There is a little business where he would be most useful--in the  South,' said Lurgan, with peculiar suavity, dropping his heavy blued  eyelids.    'E.23 has that in hand,' said Creighton quickly.  'He must not go down  there.  Besides, he knows no Turki.'    'Only tell him the shape and the smell of the letters we want and he  will bring them back,' Lurgan insisted.    'No.  That is a man's job,' said Creighton.    It was a wry-necked matter of unauthorized and incendiary  correspondence between a person who claimed to be the ultimate  authority in all matters of the Mohammedan religion throughout the  world, and a younger member of a royal house who had been brought to  book for kidnapping women within British territory.  The Moslem  Archbishop had been emphatic and over-arrogant; the young prince was  merely sulky at the curtailment of his privileges, but there was no  need he should continue a correspondence which might some day  compromise him.  One letter indeed had been procured, but the finder  was later found dead by the roadside in the habit of an Arab trader, as  E.23, taking up the work, duly reported.    These facts, and a few others not to be published, made both Mahbub and  Creighton shake their heads.    'Let him go out with his Red Lama,' said the horse-dealer with visible  effort.  'He is fond of the old man.  He can learn his paces by the  rosary at least.'    'I have had some dealings with the old man--by letter,' said Colonel  Creighton, smiling to himself.  'Whither goes he?'
