write for. I didn't notice the impending rain storm and had no umbrella

when I reached the sidewalk, to find myself confronted with an almost

tropical downpour. I would have turned back, but a taxi came up and a

woman got out, so I dashed through the rain and got in.



"Madison and Fifty-fourth," I said.



"Right," said the driver, and I heard the starter grind, and then go

on grinding. After some futile efforts, he turned to me. "Sorry, Mac.

You'll have to find another cab. Good hunting."



If possible, it was raining still harder. I opened my newspaper over

my hat and ran for the subway: three blocks. Whizzing traffic held

me up at each crossing and I was soaked when I reached the platform,

just in time to miss the local. After an abnormal delay, I got one

which exactly missed the express at Fourteenth Street. The same thing

happened at both ends of the crosstown shuttle, but I found the rain

had stopped when I got out at Fifty-first and Lexington.

As I walked across to Madison Avenue, I passed a big excavation where

they were getting ready to put up a new office building. There was the

usual crowd of buffs watching the digging machines and, in particular,

a man with a pneumatic drill who was breaking up some hard-packed clay.

While I looked, a big lump of it fell away, and for an instant I was

able to see something that looked like a chunk of dirty glass, the size

of an old-fashioned hatbox. It glittered brilliantly in the sunlight,

and then his chattering drill hit it.



There was a faint bang and the thing disintegrated. It knocked him on

his back, but he got right up and I realized he was not hurt. At the

moment of the explosion--if so feeble a thing can be called one--I

felt something sting my face and, on touching it, found blood on my




I opened the refrigerator to get some ice and saw another notice: "When

you take out the Milk or Butter, Put it Right Back. And Close the Door,

too."



Intimidated, I took my drink into the living room and sat down in

front of the typewriter. As I stared at the novel that was to liberate

me from Madison Avenue, I noticed a mistake and picked up a pencil.

When I put it down, it rolled off the desk, and with my eyes on the

manuscript, I groped under the chair for it. Then I looked down. The

pencil was standing on its end.



       *       *       *       *       *



There, I thought to myself, is that one chance in a million we hear

about, and picked up the pencil. I turned back to my novel and drank

some of the highball in hopes of inspiration and surcease from the

muggy heat, but nothing came. I went back and read the whole chapter

to try to get a forward momentum, but came to a dead stop at the last

sentence.



Damn the heat, damn the pencil, damn Madison Avenue and advertising.

My drink was gone and I went back to the kitchen and read Molly's

notes again to see if they would be like a letter from her. I noticed

one that I had missed, pinned to the door of the dumbwaiter: "Garbage

picked up at 6:30 AM so the idea is to Put it Here the Night Before. I

love you." What can you do when the girl loves you?



I made another drink and went and stared out of the living room window

at the roof opposite. The Sun was out again and a man with a stick was

exercising his flock of pigeons. They wheeled in a circle, hoping to be

allowed to perch, but were not allowed to.



Pigeons fly as a rule in formation and turn simultaneously, so that

their wings all catch the sunlight at the same time. I was thinking



The nearest man struck them up from his hand. "Okay, Houdini! So

they're not marked! All I know is five straight...."



His voice trailed away. He and the others stared at the scattered cards

on the floor. About half were face down, as might be expected, and the

rest face up--all red.



       *       *       *       *       *



Someone must have rung, because at that moment the elevator arrived and

the four men, with half frightened, incredulous looks, and in silence,

got in and were taken down. My friend stood looking at the neatly

arranged cards.



"Judas!" he said, and started to pick them up. "Will you look at that!

My God, what a session...."



I helped him and said to come in for a drink and tell me all about it,

but I had an idea what I would hear.



After a while, he calmed down, but he still seemed dazed.



"Never seen anything to equal it," he said. "Wouldn't have believed

it. Those guys _didn't_ believe it. Every round normal, nothing

unusual about the hands--three of a kind, a low straight, that sort

of thing and one guy got queens over tens, until it gets to be _my_

deal. Brother! Straight flush to the king--every time! And each time,

somebody else has four aces...."



He started to sweat again, so I got up to fix him another drink. There

was one quart of club soda left, but when I tried to open it, the top

broke and glass chips got into the bottle.



"I'll have to go down for more soda," I said.



"I'll come, too. I need air."



At the delicatessen on the corner, the man gave me three bottles in

what must have been a wet bag, because as he handed them to me over the

top of the cold-meat display, the bottom gave and they fell onto the

tile floor. None of them broke, although the fall must have been from


       *       *       *       *       *



Upstairs, the wind was blowing into the apartment and I closed the

windows, mainly to shut out the tumult and the shouting. Nat had

brightened up considerably.



"I'll stay for one more drink and then I'm due at the office," he said.

"You know, I think this would make an item for the paper." He grinned

and nodded toward the pandemonium.



When he was gone, I noticed it was getting dark and turned on the desk

lamp. Then I saw the curtains. They were all tied in knots, except

one. That was tied in three knots.



All _right_, I told myself, it was the wind. But I felt the time had

come for me to get expert advice, so I went to the phone to call

McGill. McGill is an assistant professor of mathematics at a university

uptown and lives near us. He is highly imaginative, but we believe he

knows everything.



When I picked up the receiver, the line sounded dead and I thought,

_more_ trouble. Then I heard a man cough and I said hello. McGill's

voice said, "Alec? You must have picked up the receiver just as we were

connected. That's a damn funny coincidence."



"Not in the least," I said. "Come on over here. I've got something for

you to work on."



"Well, as a matter of fact, I was calling up to ask you and Molly--"



"Molly's away for the week. Can you get over here quick? It's urgent."



"At once," he said, and hung up.



While I waited, I thought I might try getting down a few paragraphs of

my novel--perhaps something would come now. It did, but as I came to a

point where I was about to put down the word "agurgling," I decided it

was too reminiscent of Gilbert and Sullivan, and stopped at the letter

"R." Then I saw that I had unaccountably hit all four keys one step to



"No. During the week."



He shook his head. "In that case, no. Discounting the fact that you

could have prearranged it, if my dim provisional theory is right, that

would be _actually_ impossible. It would involve time-reversal. I'll

tell you about it later. No, just throw down the change. Let's see if

they all come up heads."



I moved away from the carpet and tossed the handful of coins onto the

floor. They clattered and bounced--and bounced together--and stacked

themselves into a neat pile.



I looked at McGill. His eyes were narrowed. Without a word, he took a

handful of coins from his own pocket and threw them.



These coins didn't stack. They just fell into an exactly straight line,

the adjacent ones touching.



"Well," I said, "what more do you want?"



"Great Scott," he said, and sat down. "I suppose you know that

there are two great apparently opposite principles governing the

Universe--random and design. The sands on the beach are an example

of random distribution and life is an example of design. The motions

of the particles of a gas are what we call random, but there are so

many of them, we treat them statistically and derive the Second Law of

Thermodynamics--quite reliable. It isn't theoretically hard-and-fast;

it's just a matter of extreme probability. Now life, on the other

hand, seems not to depend on probability at all; actually, it goes

against it. Or you might say it is certainly not an accidental

manifestation."



"Do you mean," I asked in some confusion, "that some form of life is

controlling the coins and--the other things?"



       *       *       *       *       *



He shook his head. "No. All I mean is that improbable things usually

have improbable explanations. When I see a natural law being broken,

I don't say to myself, 'Here's a miracle.' I revise my version of the

book of rules. Something--I don't know what--is going on, and it seems


on around here. Every goddam car's got something the matter with it.

They can't none of them back out for one reason or another. Never seen

anything like it."



Near us, two pedestrians were doing a curious little two-step as they

tried to pass one another; as soon as one of them moved aside to let

the other pass, the other would move to the same side. They both had

embarrassed grins on their faces, but before long their grins were

replaced by looks of suspicion and then determination.



"All right, smart guy!" they shouted in unison, and barged ahead,

only to collide. They backed off and threw simultaneous punches

which met in mid-air. Then began one of the most remarkable bouts

ever witnessed--a fight in which fist hit fist but never anything

else, until both champions backed away undefeated, muttering identical

excuses and threats.



       *       *       *       *       *



Danny appeared at that moment. His face was dripping. "You all right,

Mr. Graham?" he asked. "I don't know what's going on around here, but

ever since I came on this afternoon, things are going crazy. Bartley!"

he shouted--he could succeed as a hog-caller. "Bring those dames over

here!"



Three women in a confused wrangle, with their half-open umbrellas

intertwined, were brought across the street, which meant climbing over

fenders. Bartley, a fine young patrolman, seemed self-conscious; the

ladies seemed not to be.



"All right, now, Mrs. Mac-Philip!" one of them said. "Leave go of my

umbrella and we'll say no more about it!"



"And so now it's Missus Mac-Philip, is it?" said her adversary.



The third, a younger one with her back turned to us, her umbrella also

caught in the tangle, pulled at it in a tentative way, at which the

other two glared at her. She turned her head away and tried to let go,

but the handle was caught in her glove. She looked up and I saw it was

"Well," McGill said, "I'm trying to think of anything else it might be.

I'm not doing so well," he confessed.



"But so far as I can see," Molly answered, "it's mere probability, and

without any over-all pattern."



"Not quite. It has a center. Alec is the center."



       *       *       *       *       *



Molly looked at me with a curious expression for a moment. "Do you

_feel_ all right, darling?" she asked me. I nodded brightly. "You'll

think this silly of me," she went on to McGill, "but why isn't it

something like an overactive poltergeist?"



"Pure concept," he said. "No genuine evidence."



"Magnetism?"



"Absolutely not. For one thing, most of the objects affected weren't

magnetic--and don't forget magnetism is a force, not a form of energy,

and a great deal of energy has been involved. I admit the energy has

mainly been supplied by the things themselves, but in a magnetic field,

all you'd get would be stored kinetic energy, such as when a piece of

iron moves to a magnet or a line of force. Then it would just stay

there, like a rundown clock weight. These things do a lot more than

that--they go on moving."



"Why did you mention a crystal before? Why not a life-form?"



"Only an analogy," said McGill. "A crystal resembles life in that it

has a definite shape and exhibits growth, but that's all. I'll agree

this--thing--has no discernible shape and motion _is_ involved, but

plants don't move and amebas have no shape. Then a crystal feeds, but

it does not convert what it feeds on; it merely rearranges it into a

non-random pattern. In this case, it's rearranging random motions and

it has a nucleus and it seems to be growing--at least in what you might

call improbability."



Molly frowned. "Then what _is_ it? What's it made of?"



"I should say it was made of the motions. There's a similar idea about




McGill went over and they discussed the problem in undertones. Finally

the man left and Molly called her mother to reassure her. McGill tried

to explain to me what had happened with the phone.



"You must have joggled something loose. And then you replaced the

receiver in such a way that the contact wasn't quite open."



"But for Pete's sake, Molly says the calls were going on for a long

time! I phoned you only a short time ago and it must have taken her

nearly two hours to get here from Oyster Bay."



"Then you must have done it twice and the vibrations in the

floor--something like that--just happened to cause the right induction

impulses. Yes, I know how you feel," he said, seeing my expression.

"It's beginning to bear down."



Molly was through telephoning and suggested going out for dinner. I was

so pleased to see her that I'd forgotten all about being hungry.



"I'm in no mood to cook," she said. "Let's get away from all this."



McGill raised an eyebrow. "If all this, as you call it, will let us."



In the lobby, we ran into Nat, looking smug in a journalistic way.



"I've been put on the story--who could be better?--I live here. So far,

I don't quite get what's been happening. I've been talking to Danny,

but he didn't say much. I got the feeling he thinks you're involved in

some mystical, Hibernian way. Hello, McGill, what's with you?"



"He's got a theory," said Molly. "Come and eat with us and he'll tell

you all about it."



Since we decided on an air-conditioned restaurant nearby on Sixth

Avenue, we walked. The jam of cars didn't seem to be any less than

before and we saw Danny again. He was talking to a police lieutenant,

and when he caught sight of us, he said something that made the

lieutenant look at us with interest. Particularly at me.



"If you want your umbrella, Mrs. Graham," Danny said, "it's at the

station house. What there's left of it, that is."




row of glasses, put ice in them and began to pour.



That is to say he tilted the shaker over the first one, but nothing

came out. He bumped it against the side of the bar and tried again.

Still nothing. Then he took off the top and pried into it with his

pick, his face pink with exasperation.



I had the impression that the shaker had frozen solid. Well, ice _is_ a

crystal, I thought to myself.



The other bartender gave him a fresh shaker, but the same thing

happened, and I saw no more because the customers sitting at the bar

crowded around in front of him, offering advice. Our waiter came back,

baffled, saying he'd have the drinks in a moment, and went to the

kitchen. When he returned, he had madame's vichyssoise and some rolls,

which he put down, and then went to the bar, where the audience had

grown larger.



Molly lit a cigarette and said, "I suppose this is all part of it,

Alec. Incidentally, it seems to be getting warmer in here."



It was, and I had the feeling the place was quieter--a background noise

had stopped. It dawned on me that I no longer heard the faint hum of

the air-conditioner over the door, and as I started to say so, I made

a gesture toward it. My hand collided with Molly's when she tapped her

cigarette over the ashtray, and the cigarette landed in the neighboring

vichyssoise.



"Hey! What's the idea?" snarled the sour-looking man.



"I'm terribly sorry," I said. "It was an accident. I--"



"Throwing cigarettes at people!" the fat lady said.



"I really didn't mean to," I began again, getting up. There must have

been a hole in the edge of their tablecloth which one of my cuff

buttons caught in, because as I stepped out from between the closely

set tables, I pulled everything--tablecloth, silver, water glasses,

ashtrays and the vichyssoise-à-la-nicotine--onto the floor.



The fat lady surged from the banquette and slapped me meatily. The man

licked his thumb and danced as boxers are popularly supposed to do. The




"Maybe it was an accident like you say," the owner declared, "but no

one's going to push me when my back is turned! Out you go, mister! The

drinks are on the house."



"We haven't had any drinks yet," I said. "There was salt in them."



"What d'you mean, salt? My bartenders--"



The air-conditioner suddenly let out a loud whirring and I glanced

up. The stepladder which the man was on began to slide open like an

acrobatic dancer doing a split. I stepped past the angry restaurateur

and put out my hand to stop it, but as I did, the extension-bar that

was supposed to hold it together parted and it came down with a rush,

knocking over several tables. The repairman pulled part of the works

out with him as he fell and the fan-belt broke. The motor raced and

black smoke poured out.



"What're you trying to _do_!" the owner yelled at me over the loud

whine of the machinery. "Goddam it, haven't you done _enough_ already?"



I took two steps back, in dismay at what I was accused of, and stepped

on the skirt of the fat lady's green evening gown. She in turn took two

steps and was, as it were, laid bare.



The previous hubbub was as nothing to what now resulted and the smoke

was becoming thicker. Then the door opened and, to my horror, Danny and

his lieutenant came in, and I was the first thing their eyes fastened

on. Everyone started shouting at once and pointing at me.



Then the sprinkler system went on.



       *       *       *       *       *



The cell was clean, although very hot, and I was not treated badly.

There was, in fact, an air of superstitious respect, almost. A cop gave

me some magazines and, against regulations, a late paper, but it was

not late enough to carry the story of the restaurant mob-scene. In it,

however, was a garbled account of our traffic jam and a reference to

seriously injured, but I predict...."



I left and went on down the corridor.



So Bill Bart was giving me a play! What kind of crazy guess-work was

he foisting on his public, I wondered, and came to the desk room.

I looked in at the door. On one side, a sergeant was talking to an

elderly worried-looking couple and never turned his head. On the other,

a gray-haired lieutenant sitting at the raised desk dropped his glasses

as I came in. They fell on the floor and smashed.



"Mother of God!" he muttered and gave me a cursory glance. "Good night,

Doctor," he said. "Not that there's anything good about it." He was

fumbling in the desk as I walked out of the door.



       *       *       *       *       *



On the other side of the street, in the shadows, was a man who crossed

over as I came down the steps. It was McGill.



"I had a hunch this might happen," he said, taking my arm. "The car's

up ahead. Vinelli came here as quick as he could, but he slipped coming

along the street and broke his ankle."



"Judas!" I said. "I _am_ sorry! I feel responsible. Where are we going?"



He didn't answer me at first; he just kept hurrying me along. One of

those New York siroccos was pretending to cool the city, and at the

corner I saw his old coupe with the parking lights on. A saloon next to

us was closing up and a few late customers came out onto the sidewalk.

One customer, on seeing me, stopped and turned to the others.



"That's the guy I was telling you about! That's Graham!"



I saw then that it was our telephone repairman from the afternoon. He

looked reasonably sober, but his friends did not.



"Oh, yeah?" one of these said, eying me belligerently. "I thought we

just heard Bill Bart broadcast the cops had him."


"Hang onto me?"



"Yes, you're the nucleus."



       *       *       *       *       *



We were at the top of the ramp to the Westside Highway and he abruptly

put on more speed: no traffic was in sight.



"But what is it?" I asked a little wildly. "How's it doing it? Why pick

on me?"



"I don't know, but I'd say it picked you as the nucleus because you had

just been the subject of various flukes--the taxi and subway and so

on--so you represented a sample of what it's made of--flukes. I have a

hunch you'll continue to be protected."



"Did you happen to catch Bill Bart's broadcast?"



"Yes, I did. On the car radio coming over. Not good. He said--"



In the rear-view mirror, I saw a police car overhauling us. We were

doing a good sixty-five. "Here come the cops," I interrupted, but

before McGill could answer, there was a faint pop and the police car

wobbled and slowed to a stop, and was quickly out of sight.



"Blowout," I said.



"See what I mean?" McGill answered, and turned on two wheels into the

125th Street exit. Then he added, "Molly's waiting for us in my office."



I felt better.



We drove through some immortal gateway and McGill moderated his speed.

He pulled up in front of a darkened building and we climbed the steps.

It seemed cooler here and the wind was very strong. McGill tried the

door, but it was locked. Then he felt in his pocket and swore.



"No key?" I asked.



He shook his head and then shook the door, and went through his pockets

again. I reached forward and shook the door, too. The lock clicked

and we went in. I made an apologetic gesture and McGill raised his

eyebrows.



We climbed a flight of stairs, all dark except for a faint glow that

"Well, I don't feel it," I said. "I feel hemmed in."



       *       *       *       *       *



Molly glanced at me anxiously and turned back to him. "What do we do

now?"



"First, before any more funny stuff happens, I want to rig up a few

tests and see what's with Alec, if anything. I'll even test for EMF,

Molly, just for the sake of satisfying you."



"For what?" I asked.



"Electromagnetic force. Come and give me a hand, Molly. Alec, you stay

put and relax. We'll call you when we get set. I only hope to God the

cops and the news-hawks don't tumble to where we are."



They left and I went to the window and looked out at the wind blowing

papers and dust into miniature tornadoes in the dim light, and wondered

whether it was going to storm. A few belated students on the way to

their dormitories evidently were wondering the same thing, for they

were all looking up at the sky. I went to the desk and turned the radio

on, low.



"... are doing all they can, which doesn't seem much," Bill Bart was

saying breathlessly. "He was last seen speeding uptown on the Westshore

Drive, but the cops lost him. The town is gripped in superstitious

fear--it is now known that Graham was responsible for the elevators

jamming in the I.T.V. Building this morning--but how did he do it?

I ask you: how? And how has he turned off all the electric power in

Greenwich Village? I contacted the power company for an explanation,

but I was put off with the usual doubletalk. I say, and I repeat, _this

man must be caught_! He is...."



I turned him off. So that was what the street light going off had meant.



In a little while, Molly came back. "All right, duck, come and be

measured. He's got galvanometers and electronic devices and stuff,

and he'll be able to detect anything you're emanating down to a




"I wouldn't get that far," I grumbled.



"And I bet if somebody threw a knife at you, it would miss!" McGill

went on, ignoring me. "Here, I'd like to try an experiment...."



"Now, hold on!" I said.



"_McGill!_ Are you _crazy_?" Molly cried, but he ignored her also and

opened his desk drawer, from which he took a pair of dice.



"Roll me some sevens, Alec," he said, handing them to me.



"I thought we came here for a conference," I protested. "And I don't

know whether you know about it, but there's been a Village-wide

electric power failure and I'm being blamed, according to Bill Bart."



"Holy cow! When did you hear that?"



"On your radio just now. Furthermore, he says the whole town is

gripped in 'superstitious terror.'"



"That could be true," McGill answered. "Most people haven't progressed

beyond the Dark Ages. Look what happened with Orson Welles' broadcast

about the Martians."



"Maybe we ought to leave town for a while." Molly said. "We could go to

Oyster Bay or somewhere." Then she glanced up. "What's that noise?"



Outside, I now noticed, mingled with the soughing of the wind, a

susurrus of many voices. We went to the lab windows. A crowd of two or

three hundred people was standing in the campus, staring up at the sky

over us.



"What are they looking at?" McGill asked. "No one can possibly know

we're here."



I started to lean out of the window, twisting up my head to see what it

could be.



"Don't do that, Alec! They'll see you!" McGill warned, and I pulled my

head in.



"Can we get on the roof?" I asked, but Molly suddenly said, "Look who's

here." Three squad cars drove up and several policemen got out.



"Perhaps we ought to sort of very gently turn the lights off," I

suggested.



Molly immediately snapped off the shaded bench lamp, which was all

that was on in the lab. This left McGill's office light, and I started



"This is the police. Open up!"



"I won't unless you have a warrant!"



There was no more shouting. They seemed to be parlaying among

themselves, but the crowd had a menacing sound. A brilliant light

suddenly hit our windows, illuminating the lab ceiling--a police

searchlight. I saw that Molly had disappeared and I assumed she had

gone into McGill's office.



"These guys mean business," he said, "but what the hell brought them?"



"Something on the roof. That's what they're all looking at, so why

don't we go up and see?"



"All right, but you'd better stay down here. There's no parapet and

they'll see you."



He started for the door and I decided to follow--at least as far as the

trapdoor, or whatever gave onto the roof--when Molly came in from the

hall. She looked scared.



"My God! I climbed an iron ladder and took a look outside. There's a

small cyclone over us--a ton of torn papers and dust and junk whirling

around like a waterspout! They'd be able to see it for blocks!"



"Oh, great," McGill groaned. "Now it's playing tricks with the wind.

That's how they spotted us."



"We've got to get out of here, McGill," said Molly.



"Maybe the best thing would be for me to give myself up to the cops," I

said.



"I don't know whether they'd be able to get you through that mob,"

McGill replied. "Just listen to them. I only wish I could think of some

way to satisfy the damn crystal or whatever it is. I have the feeling

it wants something. It can't be merely fooling around for no reason.

But there doesn't seem to be any motive beyond the fact that it's

apparently on your side. How did it start? That's what I wish I knew."



He absently turned the bench lamp on again. I shrugged unhappily and

scratched my cheek. In so doing, I pulled the piece of pink adhesive

tape loose and it began to bleed again.



"Cut yourself shaving, darling?" Molly asked me.




took the tweezers from Molly, who had returned, and neatly removed

something from the cut. He held it under the light and looked at it

through the lens. Then he rinsed it under the water faucet, dried it on

a piece of filter-paper and looked at it again. "Well, it looks like

glass. I don't know. Maybe it's the nucleus of the glass chunk and...."

His voice trailed off and he frowned at nothing in particular, putting

the fragment down on the filter-paper.



I picked it up. It seemed like a bit of sand, only brighter.



McGill's concern over this new object of interest had been so intent

that for a few minutes our attention was diverted, but now Molly began

to pace up and down. There didn't seem to be anything for us to do, and

unlike most nurses, waiting makes her nervous. She was looking at the

display of various chemicals and reagents on the shelves.



"What's that stuff?" she asked, pointing to a large jar of black powder

labeled Deflocculated Graphite. "I bet those cops have gone for a

search warrant."



"Finely divided carbon," McGill said. "Damn, I wish I could think of

something! A chunk of glass ... blowing up...."



"Graphite is carbon?" Molly said. "You don't think they'd actually

_do_ anything to Alec, do you?"



"It's another form of carbon. A diamond is still another: the rare

crystalline form," he said. "I wouldn't put it past that mob to do

anything."



"Oh, yes. I remember that in chemistry," Molly said. "But the police

wouldn't let them, McGill, would they?"



"I've got an idea--" I tried to break in.



"They might not be able to stop them," McGill replied.



"We've got to get _out_ of here!" Molly said for the second time.



"If a diamond--" I began.



"With a helicopter, we might," McGill said. "Right now, we're

surrounded."



"How about hiding Alec?" Molly asked. "You and I could act innocent."



"I don't _want_ to be hidden," I objected. "My idea is--"



"Or better yet, we could act guilty. That would appeal to them,

Then, with lighted matches, I found my way to a door at the back of the

building, at the end. I opened it and peered out, to see a retaining

wall and stone steps leading up to ground level. I eased out into the

areaway and pulled the door shut, noticing that I still held the folded

filter-paper with the fragment in it. The lock clicked and I realized

that my bridge was, as they say, burned behind me.



Two cops were talking together a little way to my right, but their

backs were turned and they were looking up. I, too, looked and saw

the whirlpool of debris, which was exactly as Molly had described and

quite as attention-calling. Clutching the filter-paper like a talisman,

I climbed the steps and gumshoed away to the left, but as I got to the

corner, I met a group of young men, also looking up.



One of these was saying, "That's a lynch mob, if ever I saw one! I

don't get it."



"Mob psychology, that's the answer," explained another.



My heart congealed, but they walked right by me. It suddenly occurred

to me that any newspapers that had carried the story would scarcely

have been able to dig up a photograph of me yet. All I had to do was to

walk out of the campus, for who would recognize me? Where I would go

then was something I could decide later.



So I started out with more assurance, but I took the precaution to act

like an onlooker by glancing up over my shoulder now and then at the

airborne maelstrom.



As I got to the other side of the open space, I had another shock. A

few yards ahead was another group of policemen, one of whom, I saw with

dismay, was the lieutenant from Charles Street, and he was beginning to

turn around. I barely had time to duck into a doorway to avoid being

seen. I had the feeling of a member of the I.R.A. in Dublin during the

Troubles, and I crouched against the door.



I could now hear the lieutenant's voice: "Of course he's up there!


sigh of relief from McGill.



"Where in hell are you?"



"Across the way. Look, out of your window and I'll turn my light off

and on again." I did so.



"You're in Professor Crandal's office. Why did you leave?"



"We'll go into that later. McGill, that fragment is a diamond."



"What!"



"At any rate, it scratches glass."



"Why didn't you tell me that before? And where is it? I couldn't find

it anywhere."



"I was sidetracked. I've got it here. Now my idea--"



"A diamond! I begin to see light. Give with the idea, Alec."



"Well, there was all this talk of crystals and then you were telling

Molly about carbon and diamonds, and it occurred to me that what we

have is something trying to crystallize--something that once _was_ a

crystal, and got broken up and wants to re-form. It keeps trying with

playing cards and pigeons and automobiles, but it's no go. Why don't we

give it some carbon to play with, McGill?"



       *       *       *       *       *



There was a short silence. I looked across at the office, but I

couldn't see him. I noticed a piece of dirty newspaper that had fallen

out of the maelstrom and had caught on a thick wire that stretched from

one of the lab windows to immediately below mine--some kind of aerial,

I imagined. Then I saw that the maelstrom, rather than breaking up, as

I had thought, was moving over in my direction. I would be pointed out

again.



"You mean the graphite, I suppose," McGill said. "Why in hell did you

leave and take the fragment with you?"



"I forgot it was in my hand," I said, dodging the first part of the

question. "Nobody on the campus recognized me, so I guess I can walk

back." Then I remembered the locked basement door and the fact that

harp-string, but did not give noticeably, and I put my other foot on

it. Then I almost blacked out and closed my eyes.



When I opened them again, I found I had progressed some distance into

the void. Nothing was holding me from over-balancing, but my body

seemed to right itself automatically, as if I were a veteran tightrope

walker.



In a frozen daze, I edged along, keeping my eyes fixed on the distant

window in which I could see McGill and Molly watching me with white

faces.



       *       *       *       *       *



When I was about half way, the crowd caught sight of me and yelled. A

man with a broad-brimmed hat ran out from the others and, to my horror,

pulled out a gun. Another man picked up a stone, wound himself up like

a sand-lot pitcher, and hurled it just before the other pulled his

trigger. They were excellent shots: the stone was hit by the bullet and

both disintegrated. The man's gun jammed at his second try and the two

heroes were grabbed by the police.



With my heart pounding, I kept going, until, about four yards from

safety, my foot caught, and I looked down again. There was a splice

in the wire, sticking up from which was a sharp end. I staggered and

righted myself ... and let go of the filter-paper.



By now, the maelstrom was directly over me and my talisman was caught

in the up-draught. It did not fall, but I did. After a sickening

instant, I was brought up with a jerk that nearly strangled me. The

back of my coat had caught on the projecting wire and I swung there

like an unused marionette.



The crowd shouted and milled around, and the cops called out directions

to each other. One order was to send for the Fire Department. I found I

could breathe, but I could not look down.



The all-important paper was fluttering around near the lab window


The lieutenant had the hook-and-ladder driven to a distant police

station, where in due course Vinelli, the lawyer, arrived with his

foot in a cast, and I was bailed out. The cops showed me surprising

consideration; it turned out they were furious at the irresponsible

riding they had been getting from Bill Bart. A scientific big-shot

that McGill knew, named Joe Stein, convinced them I was in no way to

blame, and the case was dropped. Professor Stein gave a wonderfully

incomprehensible but tranquilizing statement to the press, and Molly

and I went to Oyster Bay.



"In two weeks, everybody'll have forgotten all about it," the

lieutenant told us. "You may even be a hero. I don't know."



Before we left, we went with McGill to the lab and saw the diamond. It

sat on a bench, gleaming brilliant, smooth-faceted and without a flaw.

It was at least two feet across, about the same as the chunk of "glass"

on Fifty-first Street.



"The cops never recognized what it was," McGill said, "it being so big."



"Who would?" Molly asked. "McGill, I've got an idea--"



"All I had to do," McGill said, ignoring her, "was to put the graphite

on some cinder blocks and the fragment on the graphite. Then I turned

a bunsen flame on it and it caught fire with a terrifically bright

flame--very small--I guess you saw it." I nodded. "It didn't give off

any heat," he went on. "Adiabatic process. And it got its necessary

pressure from the random motions together of the graphite particles.

Some random motions! When that was used up, it started on the cinder

blocks and then the CO_{2} in the air. That's what caused the suction:

the blinds were blown straight in. You probably missed that." I shook

my head. "Anyway, this thing--"



"McGill," Molly interrupted, "I've got an _idea_!"



"--this thing has got to be dumped out at sea."



"Oh," Molly said, looking crest-fallen. "I was just going to say why

don't we break a piece off and sell it in Amsterdam?"



"Good God, no! That would only start it up all over again!"
