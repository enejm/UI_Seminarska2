CHAPTER 1    IN MOONFLEET VILLAGE    So sleeps the pride of former days--_More_      The village of Moonfleet lies half a mile from the sea on the right or  west bank of the Fleet stream. This rivulet, which is so narrow as it  passes the houses that I have known a good jumper clear it without a  pole, broadens out into salt marshes below the village, and loses itself 
Mohune, in the dreadful wars against King Charles the First, had deserted  the allegiance of his house and supported the cause of the rebels. So  being made Governor of Carisbrooke Castle for the Parliament, he became  there the King's jailer, but was false to his trust. For the King,  carrying constantly hidden about his person a great diamond which had  once been given him by his brother King of France, Mohune got wind of  this jewel, and promised that if it were given him he would wink at His  Majesty's escape. Then this wicked man, having taken the bribe, plays  traitor again, comes with a file of soldiers at the hour appointed for  the King's flight, finds His Majesty escaping through a window, has him  away to a stricter ward, and reports to the Parliament that the King's  escape is only prevented by Colonel Mohune's watchfulness. But how true,  as Mr. Glennie said, that we should not be envious against the ungodly,  against the man that walketh after evil counsels. Suspicion fell on  Colonel Mohune; he was removed from his Governorship, and came back to  his home at Moonfleet. There he lived in seclusion, despised by both  parties in the State, until he died, about the time of the happy  Restoration of King Charles the Second. But even after his death he could  not get rest; for men said that he had hid somewhere that treasure given  him to permit the King's escape, and that not daring to reclaim it, had  let the secret die with him, and so must needs come out of his grave to  try to get at it again. Mr. Glennie would never say whether he believed  the tale or not, pointing out that apparitions both of good and evil  spirits are related in Holy Scripture, but that the churchyard was an  unlikely spot for Colonel Mohune to seek his treasure in; for had it been  buried there, he would have had a hundred chances to have it up in his  lifetime. However this may be, though I was brave as a lion by day, and  used indeed to frequent the churchyard, because there was the widest  view of the sea to be obtained from it, yet no reward would have taken me 
fetch me a plasterer's hammer which I have left behind, so that I can  try this mortar.'    I knew that he was making excuses about underpinning, for the wall was  sound as a rock, but was glad enough to take him at his word and beat a  retreat from where I was not wanted. Indeed, I soon saw how he was  mocking me, for the men did not even wait for me to come back with the  hammer, but I met them returning in the first meadow. Master Ratsey made  another excuse that he did not need the hammer now, as he had found out  that all that was wanted was a little pointing with new mortar. 'But if  you have such time to waste, John,' he added, 'you can come tomorrow and  help me to get new thwarts in the _Petrel_, which she badly wants.'    So we three came back to the village together; but looking up at Elzevir  once while Master Ratsey was making these pretences, I saw his eyes  twinkle under their heavy brows, as if he was amused at the other's  embarrassment.    The next Sunday, when we went to church, all was quiet as usual,  there was no Elzevir, and no more noises, and I never heard the  Mohunes move again.          CHAPTER 3    A DISCOVERY    Some bold adventurers disdain  The limits of their little reign,  And unknown regions dare descry;  Still, as they run, they look behind,  They hear a voice in every wind  And snatch a fearful joy--_Gray_      I have said that I used often in the daytime, when not at school, to go  to the churchyard, because being on a little rise, there was the best  view of the sea to be had from it; and on a fine day you could watch the  French privateers creeping along the cliffs under the Snout, and lying in  wait for an Indiaman or up-channel trader. There were at Moonfleet few  boys of my own age, and none that I cared to make my companion; so I was  given to muse alone, and did so for the most part in the open air, all 
all ruined and rotten--some still clinging, water-sodden, to the coffins,  and some trampled in the sand of the floor. I had spent some time in this  bootless search, and was resolved to give up further inquiry and foot it  home, when the clock in the tower struck midnight. Surely never was  ghostly hour sounded in more ghostly place. Moonfleet peal was known over  half the county, and the finest part of it was the clock bell. 'Twas said  that in times past (when, perhaps, the chimes were rung more often than  now) the voice of this bell had led safe home boats that were lost in the  fog; and this night its clangour, mellow and profound, reached even to  the vault. Bim-bom it went, bim-bom, twelve heavy thuds that shook the  walls, twelve resonant echoes that followed, and then a purring and  vibration of the air, so that the ear could not tell when it ended.    I was wrought up, perhaps, by the strangeness of the hour and place, and  my hearing quicker than at other times, but before the tremor of the bell  was quite passed away I knew there was some other sound in the air, and  that the awful stillness of the vault was broken. At first I could not  tell what this new sound was, nor whence it came, and now it seemed a  little noise close by, and now a great noise in the distance. And then it  grew nearer and more defined, and in a moment I knew it was the sound of  voices talking. They must have been a long way off at first, and for a  minute, that seemed as an age, they came no nearer. What a minute was  that to me! Even now, so many years after, I can recall the anguish of  it, and how I stood with ears pricked up, eyes starting, and a clammy  sweat upon my face, waiting for those speakers to come. It was the  anguish of the rabbit at the end of his burrow, with the ferret's eyes  gleaming in the dark, and gun and lurcher waiting at the mouth of the  hole. I was caught in a trap, and knew beside that contraband-men had a 
hours before, that I should ever have courage to do this by night in the  Mohune vault, I would not have believed him. Yet here I was, and had  advanced along the path of terror so gradually, and as it were foot by  foot in the past night, that when I came to this final step I was not  near so scared as when I first felt my way into the vault. It was not the  first time either that I had looked on death; but had, indeed, always a  leaning to such sights and matters, and had seen corpses washed up from  the _Darius_ and other wrecks, and besides that had helped Ratsey to case  some poor bodies that had died in their beds.    The coffin was, as I have said, of great length, and the side being  removed, I could see the whole outline of the skeleton that lay in it. I  say the outline, for the form was wrapped in a woollen or flannel shroud,  so that the bones themselves were not visible. The man that lay in it was  little short of a giant, measuring, as I guessed, a full six and a half  feet, and the flannel having sunk in over the belly, the end of the  breast-bone, the hips, knees, and toes were very easy to be made out. The  head was swathed in linen bands that had been white, but were now stained  and discoloured with damp, but of this I shall not speak more, and  beneath the chin-cloth the beard had once escaped. The clutch which I had  made to save myself in falling had torn away this chin-band and let the  lower jaw drop on the breast; but little else was disturbed, and there  was Colonel John Mohune resting as he had been laid out a century ago. I  lifted that portion of the lid which had been left behind, and reached  over to see if there was anything hid on the other side of the body; but  had scarce let the light fall in the coffin when my heart gave a great  bound, and all fear left me in the flush of success, for there I saw what  I had come to seek. 
often came to see me, said--    'John, there is only Elzevir and I who know that you have seen the  inside of our bond-cellar; and 'tis well, for if some of the landers  guessed, they might have ugly ways to stop all chance of prating. So  keep our secret tight, and we'll keep yours, for "he that refraineth his  lips is wise".'    I wondered how Master Ratsey could quote Scripture so pat, and yet cheat  the revenue; though, in truth, 'twas thought little sin at Moonfleet to  run a cargo; and, perhaps, he guessed what I was thinking, for he added--    'Not that a Christian man has aught to be ashamed of in landing a cask of  good liquor, for we read that when Israel came out of Egypt, the chosen  people were bid trick their oppressors out of jewels of silver and jewels  of gold; and among those cruel taskmasters, Some of the worst must  certainly have been the tax-gatherers.'    *       *       *       *       *    The first walk I took when I grew stronger and was able to get about was  up to Aunt Jane's, notwithstanding she had never so much as been to ask  after me all these days. She knew, indeed, where I was, for Ratsey had  told her I lay at the Why Not?, explaining that Elzevir had found me one  night on the ground famished and half-dead, yet not saying where. But my  aunt greeted me with hard words, which I need not repeat here; for,  perhaps, she meant them not unkindly, but only to bring me back again to  the right way. She did not let me cross the threshold, holding the door  ajar in her hand, and saying she would have no tavern-loungers in her  house, but that if I liked the Why Not? so well, I could go back there  again for her. I had been for begging her pardon for playing truant; but  when I heard such scurvy words, felt the devil rise in my heart, and only 
and Elzevir's face grew black as night; but the bailiff and clerk showed  no surprise, not knowing the terms on which persons in our village stood  to one another, and thinking it natural that someone should come in to  see the pin drop, and the end of an ancient custom. Indeed, Maskew seemed  to know the bailiff, for he passed the time of day with him, and was then  for sitting down at the table without taking any notice of Elzevir or me.  But just as he began to seat himself, Block shouted out, 'You are no  welcome visitor in my house, and I would sooner see your back than see  your face, but sit at this table you shall not.' I knew what he meant;  for on that table they had laid out David's body, and with that he struck  his fist upon the board so smart as to make the bailiff jump and nearly  bring the pin out of the candle.    'Heyday, sirs,' says Mr. Bailiff, astonished, 'let us have no brawling  here, the more so as this worshipful gentleman is a magistrate and  something of a friend of mine.' Yet Maskew refrained from sitting, but  stood by the bailiff's chair, turning white, and not red, as he did with  Mr. Glennie; and muttered something, that he had as lief stand as sit,  and that it should soon be Block's turn to ask sitting-room of _him_.    I was wondering what possibly could have brought Maskew there, when the  bailiff, who was ill at ease, said--'Come, Mr. Clerk, the pin hath but  another minute's hold; rehearse what has been done, for I must get this  lease delivered and off to Bridport, where much business waits.'    So the clerk read in a singsong voice that the property of the duchy of  Cornwall, called the Mohune Arms, an inn or tavern, with all its land,  tenements, and appurtenances, situate in the Parish of St. Sebastian,  Moonfleet, having been offered on lease for five years, would be let to  Elzevir Block at a rent of 12 per annum, unless anyone offered a higher  rent before the pin fell from the candle.    There was no one to make another offer, and the bailiff said to Elzevir, 
lie in wait for Grace, to tell her what was up, and that we were going  away to Worth.    Next day, the 16th of April--a day I have had cause to remember all my  life--I played truant from Mr. Glennie, and by ten in the forenoon found  myself in the woods.    There was a little dimple on the hillside above the house, green with  burdocks in summer and filled with dry leaves in winter--just big enough  to hold one lying flat, and not so deep but that I could look over the  lip of it and see the house without being seen. Thither I went that day,  and lay down in the dry leaves to wait and watch for Grace.    The morning was bright enough. The chills of the night before had given  way to sunlight that seemed warm as summer, and yet had with it the soft  freshness of spring. There was scarce a breath moving in the wood, though  I could see the clouds of white dust stalking up the road that climbs  Ridge down, and the trees were green with buds, yet without leafage to  keep the sunbeams from lighting up the ground below, which glowed with  yellow king-cups. So I lay there for a long, long while; and to make time  pass quicker, took from my bosom the silver locket, and opening it, read  again the parchment, which I had read times out of mind before, and knew  indeed by heart.    'The days of our age are threescore years and ten', and the rest.    Now, whenever I handled the locket, my thoughts were turned to Mohune's  treasure; and it was natural that it should be so, for the locket  reminded me of my first journey to the vault; and I laughed at myself,  remembering how simple I had been, and had hoped to find the place  littered with diamonds, and to see the gold lying packed in heaps. And  thus for the hundredth time I came to rack my brain to know where the  diamond could be hid, and thought at last it must be buried in the  churchyard, because of the talk of Blackbeard being seen on wild nights 
pushed me off; and though I saw that he was loth to do it, I had a  terrible conviction that he was not a man to be turned back from his  resolve, and would go through with it to the end.    We came back together from the brambles to the piece of sward, and there  sat Maskew where we had left him with his back against the stone. Only,  while we were away he had managed to wriggle his watch out of the fob,  and it lay beside him on the turf, tied to him with a black silk riband.  The face of it was turned upwards, and as I passed I saw the hand pointed  to five. Sunrise was very near; for though the cliff shut out the east  from us, the west over Portland was all aglow with copper-red and gold,  and the candle burnt low. The head of the pin was drooping, though very  slightly, but as I saw it droop a month before, and I knew that the final  act was not far off.    Maskew knew it too, for he made his last appeal, using such passionate  words as I cannot now relate, and wriggling with his body as if to get  his hands from behind his back and hold them up in supplication. He  offered money; a thousand, five thousand, ten thousand pounds to be set  free; he would give back the Why Not?; he would leave Moonfleet; and all  the while the sweat ran down his furrowed face, and at last his voice was  choked with sobs, for he was crying for his life in craven fear.    He might have spoken to a deaf man for all he moved his judge; and  Elzevir's answer was to cock the pistol and prime the powder in the pan.    Then I stuck my fingers in my ears and shut my eyes, that I might  neither see nor hear what followed, but in a second changed my mind and  opened them again, for I had made a great resolve to stop this matter,  come what might.    Maskew was making a dreadful sound between a moan and strangled cry; it  almost seemed as if he thought that there were others by him beside 
seemed now but the gentlest of breezes, fresh with the breath of the  kindly sea. But this was only for a moment, for the anguish came back  and grew apace, and I fell to thinking dismally of the plight we were in.  How things had been against us in these last days! First there was losing  the Why Not? and that was bad enough; second, there was the being known  by the Excise for smugglers, and perhaps for murderers; third and last,  there was the breaking of my leg, which made escape so difficult. But,  most of all, there came before my eyes that grey face turned up against  the morning sun, and I thought of all it meant for Grace, and would have  given my own life to call back that of our worst enemy.    Then Elzevir sat up, stretching himself like one waking out of sleep, and  said: 'We must be gone. They will not be back for some time yet, and,  when they come, will not think to search closely for us hereabouts; but  that we cannot risk, and must get clear away. This leg of thine will keep  us tied for weeks, and we must find some place where we can lie hid, and  tend it. Now, I know such a hiding-hole in Purbeck, which they call  Joseph's Pit, and thither we must go; but it will take all the day to get  there, for it is seven miles off, and I am older than I was, and thou too  heavy a babe to carry over lightly.'    I did not know the pit he spoke of, but was glad to hear of some place,  however far off, where I could lie still and get ease from the pain. And  so he took me in his arms again and started off across the fields.    I need not tell of that weary journey, and indeed could not, if I wished;  for the pain went to my head and filled me with such a drowsy anguish  that I knew nothing except when some unlooked-for movement gave me a  sharper twinge, and made me cry out. At first Elzevir walked briskly, but  as the day wore on went slower, and was fain more than once to put me 
slightest swell there is a dull and distant booming of the surge in those  cavernous deeps; and when the wind blows fresh, each roller smites the  cliff like a thunder-clap, till even the living rock trembles again.    It was on a ledge of that rock-face that our cave opened, and sometimes  on a fine day Elzevir would carry me out thither, so that I might sun  myself and see all the moving Channel without myself being seen. For this  ledge was carved out something like a balcony, so that when the quarry  was in working they could lower the stone by pulleys to boats lying  underneath, and perhaps haul up a keg or two by the way of ballast, as  might be guessed by the stanchions still rusting in the rock.    Such was this gallery; and as for the inside of the cave, 'twas a great  empty room, with a white floor made up of broken stone-dust trodden hard  of old till one would say it was plaster; and dry, without those sweaty  damps so often seen in such places--save only in one corner a  land-spring dropped from the roof trickling down over spiky  rock-icicles, and falling into a little hollow in the floor. This basin  had been scooped out of set purpose, with a gutter seaward for the  overflow, and round it and on the wet patch of the roof above grew a  garden of ferns and other clinging plants.    The weeks moved on until we were in the middle of May, when even the  nights were no longer cold, as the sun gathered power. And with the  warmer days my strength too increased, and though I dared not yet stand,  my leg had ceased to pain me, except for some sharp twinges now and then,  which Elzevir said were caused by the bone setting. And then he would put  a poultice made of grass upon the place, and once walked almost as far as  Chaldron to pluck sorrel for a soothing mash.    Now though he had gone out and in so many times in safety, yet I was  always ill at ease when he was away, lest he might fall into some ambush 
happened about her father's death, saving only that Elzevir had meant  himself to put Maskew away; for it was no use to tell her this when she  had said that he could never think to do such a thing, and besides, for  all I knew, he never did mean to shoot, but only to frighten him. Though  I thus resolved, I said nothing of it to Master Ratsey, but only nodded,  and he went on--    'Well, seeing there was no one save this poor girl to look to putting  Maskew under ground, I must needs take it in hand myself; roughing  together a sound coffin and digging as fair a grave for him as could be  made for any lord, except that lords have always vaults to sleep in. Then  I got Mother Nutting's fish-cart to carry the body down, for there was  not a man in Moonfleet would lay hand to the coffin to bear it; and off  we started down the street, I leading the wall-eyed pony, and the coffin  following on the trolley. There was no mourner to see him home except his  daughter, and she without a bit of black upon her, for she had no time to  get her crapes; and yet she needed none, having grief writ plain enough  upon her face.    'When we got to the churchyard, a crowd was gathered there, men and women  and children, not only from Moonfleet but from Ringstave and Monkbury.  They were not come to mourn, but to make gibes to show how much they  hated him, and many of the children had old pots and pans for rough  music. Parson Glennie was waiting in the church, and there he waited, for  the cart could not pass the gate, and we had no bearers to lift the  coffin. Then I looked round to see if there was any that would help to  lift, but when I tried to meet a man's eye he looked away, and all I  could see was the bitter scowling faces of the women. And all the while  the girl stood by the trolley looking on the ground. She had a little  kerchief over her head that let the hair fall about her shoulders, and 
as carters do to horses. And for all he was so grave, there was a smile  on his face too, and he showed me how to twist a wisp of straw out of the  bed to bind above my ankles at the bottom of the leggings. He had cut off  his beard, and yet lost nothing of his looks; for his jaw and deep chin  showed firm and powerful. And as for me, we made a broth of young walnut  leaves and twigs, and tanned my hands and face with it a ruddy brown, so  that I looked a different lad.          CHAPTER 13    AN INTERVIEW    No human creature stirred to go or come,  No face looked forth from shut or open casement,  No chimney smoked, there was no sign of home  From parapet to basement--_Hood_      And so the days went on, until there came to be but two nights more  before we were to leave our cave. Now I have said that the delay chafed  us, because we were impatient to get at the treasure; but there was  something else that vexed me and made me more unquiet with every day that  passed. And this was that I had resolved to see Grace before I left these  parts, and yet knew not how to tell it to Elzevir. But on this evening,  seeing the time was grown so short, I knew that I must speak or drop my  purpose, and so spoke.    We were sitting like the sea-birds on the ledge outside our cave, looking  towards St. Alban's Head and watching the last glow of sunset. The  evening vapours began to sweep down Channel, and Elzevir shrugged his  shoulders. 'The night turns chill,' he said, and got up to go back to the  cave. So then I thought my time was come, and following him inside said:    'Dear Master Elzevir, you have watched over me all this while and tended  me kinder than any father could his son; and 'tis to you I owe my life,  and that my leg is strong again. Yet I am restless this night, and beg 
  'Good-bye, good-bye,' I said, and dropped on to the soft leafy bottom  of the wood.          CHAPTER 14    THE WELL-HOUSE    For those thou mayest not look upon  Are gathering fast round the yawning stone--_Scott_      It wanted yet half an hour of midnight when I found myself at the shaft  of the marble quarry, and before I had well set foot on the steps to  descend, heard Elzevir's voice challenging out of the darkness below. I  gave back '_Prosper the Bonaventure',_ and so came home again to sleep  the last time in our cave.    The next night was well suited to flight. There was a spring-tide with  full moon, and a light breeze setting off the land which left the water  smooth under the cliff. We saw the _Bonaventure_ cruising in the Channel  before sundown, and after the darkness fell she lay close in and took us  off in her boat. There were several men on board of her that I knew, and  they greeted us kindly, and made much of us. I was indeed glad to be  among them again, and yet felt a pang at leaving our dear Dorset coast,  and the old cave that had been hospital and home to me for two months.    The wind set us up-Channel, and by daybreak they put us ashore at Cowes,  so we walked to Newport and came there before many were stirring. Such as  we saw in the street paid no heed to us but took us doubtless for some  carter and his boy who had brought corn in from the country for the  Southampton packet, and were about early to lead the team home again.  'Tis a little place enough this Newport, and we soon found the Bugle; but  Elzevir made so good a carter that the landlord did not know him, though  he had his acquaintance before. So they fenced a little with one another.    'Have you bed and victuals for a plain country man and his boy?'  says Elzevir.    'Nay, that I have not,' says the landlord, looking him up and down, and 
me and what I sought.    The sides of this well are not moist, green, or clammy, like the sides of  some others where damp and noxious exhalations abound, but dry and clean;  for it is said that there are below hidden entrances and exits for the  water, which keep it always moving. So these bricks were also dry and  clean, and this mark as sharp as if made yesterday, though the issue  showed that 'twas put there a very long time ago. Now the mark was not  deeply or regularly graven, but roughly scratched, as I have known boys  score their names, or alphabet letters, or a date, on the alabaster  figures that lie in Moonfleet Church. And here, too, was scored a letter  of the alphabet, a plain 'Y', and would have passed for nothing more  perhaps to any not born in Moonfleet; but to me it was the _cross-pall,_  or black 'Y' of the Mohunes, under whose shadow we were all brought up.  So as soon as I saw that, I knew I was near what I sought, and that  Colonel John Mohune had put this sign there a century ago, either by his  own hands or by those of a servant; and then I thought of Mr. Glennie's  story, that the Colonel's conscience was always unquiet, because of a  servant whom he had put away, and now I seemed to understand something  more of it.    My heart throbbed fiercely, as many another's heart has throbbed when he  has come near the fulfilment of a great desire, whether lawful or guilty,  and I tried to get at the brick. But though by holding on to the rope  with my left hand, I could reach over far enough to touch the brick with  my right 'twas as much as I could do, and so I shouted up the well that  they must bring me nearer in to the side. They understood what I would be  at, and slipped a noose over the well-rope and so drew it in to the side,  and made it fast till I should give the word to loose again. Thus I was  brought close to the well-wall, and the marked brick near about the level 
was last seen.    Yet in this thing at least Fortune favoured us, for there was now lying  at Cowes, and ready to sail that night, a Dutch couper that had run a  cargo of Hollands on the other side of the island, and was going back to  Scheveningen freighted with wool. Our landlord knew the Dutch captain  well, having often done business for him, and so could give us letters of  recommendation which would ensure us a passage to the Low Countries. Thus  in the afternoon we were on the road, making our way from Newport to  Cowes in a new disguise, for we had changed our clothes again, and now  wore the common sailor dress of blue.    The clouds had returned after the rain, and the afternoon was wet, and  worse than the morning, so I shall not say anything of another weary and  silent walk. We arrived on Cowes quay by eight in the evening, and found  the couper ready to make sail, and waiting only for the tide to set out.  Her name was the _Gouden Droom_, and she was a little larger than the  _Bonaventure_, but had a smaller crew, and was not near so well found.  Elzevir exchanged a few words with the captain, and gave him the  landlord's letter, and after that they let us come on board, but said  nothing to us. We judged that we were best out of the way, so went below;  and finding her laden deep, and even the cabin full of bales of wool,  flung ourselves on them to rest. I was so tired and heavy with sleep that  my eyes closed almost before I was lain down, and never opened till the  next morning was well advanced.    I shall not say anything about our voyage, nor how we came safe to  Scheveningen, because it has little to do with this story. Elzevir had  settled that we should go to Holland, not only because the couper was  waiting to sail thither for we might doubtless have found other boats  before long to take us elsewhere--but also because he had learned at  Newport that the Hague was the first market in the world for diamonds. 
face with men in fair fight, and never felt a death-blow given so weigh  on my soul; but these two men came to a tricksy kind of end, and yet I  could not help it. 'Tis true that all my life I've served the  Contraband, but no man ever knew me do a foul action; and now I do not  like that men should call me felon, and like it less that they should  call thee felon too. Perhaps there may be after all some curse that hangs  about this stone, and leads to ruin those that handle it. I cannot say,  for I am not a Parson Glennie in these things; but Blackbeard in an evil  mood may have tied the treasure up to be a curse to any that use it for  themselves. What do we want with this thing at all? I have got money to  be touched at need; we may lie quiet this side the Channel, where thou  shalt learn an honest trade, and when the mischief has blown over we will  go back to Moonfleet. So let the jewel be, John; shall we not let the  jewel be?'    He spoke earnestly, and most earnestly at the end, taking me by the hand  and looking me full in the face. But I could not look him back again, and  turned my eyes away, for I was wilful, and would not bring myself to let  the diamond go. Yet all the while I thought that what he said was true,  and I remembered that sermon that Mr. Glennie preached, saying that life  was like a 'Y', and that to each comes a time when two ways part, and  where he must choose whether he will take the broad and sloping road or  the steep and narrow path. So now I guessed that long ago I had chosen  the broad road, and now was but walking farther down it in seeking after  this evil treasure, and still I could not bear to give all up, and  persuaded myself that it was a child's folly to madly fling away so fine  a stone. So instead of listening to good advice from one so much older  than me, I set to work to talk him over, and persuaded him that if we got 
little enough clothes upon my back to keep off rain and cold. On either  side rode guards on horseback, with loaded flint-locks across the  saddlebow, and long whips in their hands with which they let fly at any  laggard; though 'twas hard enough for men to walk where the mud was over  the horses' fetlocks. I had no chance to speak to Elzevir all the  journey, and indeed spoke nothing at all, for those to whom I was chained  were brute beasts rather than men, and spoke only in Dutch to boot.    There was but little of the building of the fortress begun when we  reached Ymeguen, and the task that we were set to was the digging of the  trenches and other earthworks. I believe that there were five hundred men  employed in this way, and all of them condemned like us to galley-work  for life. We were divided into squads of twenty-five, but Elzevir was  drafted to another squad and a different part of the workings, so I saw  him no more except at odd times, now and again, when our gangs met, and  we could exchange a word or two in passing.    Thus I had no solace of any company but my own, and was driven to  thinking, and to occupy my mind with the recollection of the past. And at  first the life of my boyhood, now lost for ever, was constantly present  even in my dreams, and I would wake up thinking that I was at school  again under Mr. Glennie, or talking in the summer-house with Grace, or  climbing Weatherbeech Hill with the salt Channel breeze singing through  the trees. But alas! these things faded when I opened my eyes, and knew  the foul-smelling wood-hut and floor of fetid straw where fifty of us lay  in fetters every night; I say I dreamt these things at first, but by  degrees remembrance grew blunted and the images less clear, and even  these sweet, sad visions of the night came to me less often. Thus life  became a weary round, in which month followed month, season followed  season, year followed year, and brought always the same eternal  profitless-work. And yet the work was merciful, for it dulled the biting 
really liked Elzevir, and partly that they might have a sailor in the  boat to direct them; but the others cast off and left us with a curse,  saying that we might go and drown for obstinate Englishmen.    So we two were left alone on the brig, which kept drifting backwards  slowly; but the pinnace was soon lost to sight, though we saw that they  were rowing wild as soon as she passed out of the shelter of the ship,  and that they had much ado to keep her head to the sea.    Then Elzevir went to the kicking-wheel, and beckoned me to help him, and  between us we put the helm hard up. I saw then that he had given up all  hope of the wind shifting, and was trying to run her dead for the beach.    She was broached-to with her bows in the wind, but gradually paid off as  the staysail filled, and so she headed straight for shore. The November  night had fallen, and it was very dark, only the white fringe of the  breakers could be seen, and grew plainer as we drew closer to it. The  wind was blowing fiercer than ever, and the waves broke more fiercely  nearer the shore. They had lost their dirty yellow colour when the light  died, and were rolling after us like great black mountains, with a  combing white top that seemed as if they must overwhelm us every minute.  Twice they pooped us, and we were up to our waists in icy water, but  still held to the wheel for our lives.    The white line was nearer to us now, and above all the rage of wind and  sea I could hear the awful roar of the under-tow sucking back the  pebbles on the beach. The last time I could remember hearing that roar  was when I lay, as a boy, one summer's night 'twixt sleep and waking, in  the little whitewashed bedroom at my aunt's; and I wondered now if any  sat before their inland hearths this night, and hearing that far distant  roar, would throw another log on the fire, and thank God they were not  fighting for their lives in Moonfleet Bay. I could picture all that was 
another time I should have put a thousand to him myself; and he seeing  'twas no good sat by me in silence, using a spy-glass now and again to  make out the things floating at sea. As the day grew the men left the  fire at the back of the beach, and came down to the sea-front where the  waves were continually casting up fresh spoil. And there all worked with  a will, not each one for his own hand, but all to make a common hoard  which should be divided afterwards.    Among the flotsam moving outside the breakers I could see more than one  dark ball, like black buoys, bobbing up and down, and lifting as the  wave came by: and knew them for the heads of drowned men. Yet though I  took Ratsey's glass and scanned all carefully enough, I could make  nothing of them, but saw the pinnace floating bottom up, and farther out  another boat deserted and down to her gunwale in the water. 'Twas midday  before the first body was cast up, when the sky was breaking a little,  and a thin and watery sun trying to get through, and afterwards three  other bodies followed. They were part of the pinnace's crew, for all had  the iron ring on the left wrist, as Ratsey told me, who went down to see  them, though he said nothing of the branded 'Y', and they were taken up  and put under some sheeting at the back of the beach, there to lie till a  grave should be made ready for them.    Then I felt something that told me he was coming and saw a body rolled  over in the surf, and knew it for the one I sought. 'Twas nearest me he  was flung up, and I ran down the beach, caring nothing for the white  foam, nor for the under-tow, and laid hold of him: for had he not left  the rescue-line last night, and run down into the surf to save my  worthless life? Ratsey was at my side, and so between us we drew him up  out of the running foam, and then I wrung the water from his hair, and  wiped his face and, kneeling down there, kissed him.
