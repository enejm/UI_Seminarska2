The Fountain of Oblivion          To My Readers      Curiously enough, in the events which have taken place in the last few  years in our "great outside world," we may find incidents so marvelous  and inspiring that I cannot hope to equal them with stories of The Land  of Oz.    However, "The Magic of Oz" is really more strange and unusual than  anything I have read or heard about on our side of The Great Sandy  Desert which shuts us off from The Land of Oz, even during the past  exciting years, so I hope it will appeal to your love of novelty.    A long and confining illness has prevented my answering all the good  letters sent me--unless stamps were enclosed--but from now on I hope to  be able to give prompt attention to each and every letter with which my  readers favor me.    Assuring you that my love for you has never faltered and hoping the Oz  Books will continue to give you pleasure as long as I am able to write  them, I am    Yours affectionately,    L. FRANK BAUM,  "Royal Historian of Oz."  "OZCOT"  at HOLLYWOOD  in CALIFORNIA  1919          1.  Mount Munch      On the east edge of the Land of Oz, in the Munchkin Country, is a big,  tall hill called Mount Munch.  One one side, the bottom of this hill 
 yard and a pleasant-faced woman came to the door and called him to  supper.    That made Kiki wonder what sort of food hawks ate.  He felt hungry, but  didn't know what to eat or where to get it.  Also he thought a bed  would be more comfortable than a tree-top for sleeping, so he hopped to  the ground and said: "I want to become Kiki Aru again--Pyrzqxgl!"    Instantly he had resumed his natural shape, and going to the house, he  knocked upon the door and asked for some supper.    "Who are you?" asked the man of the house.    "A stranger from the Land of Oz," replied Kiki Aru.    "Then you are welcome," said the man.    Kiki was given a good supper and a good bed, and he behaved very well,  although he refused to answer all the questions the good people of  Noland asked him.  Having escaped from his home and found a way to see  the world, the young man was no longer unhappy, and so he was no longer  cross and disagreeable.  The people thought him a very respectable  person and gave him breakfast next morning, after which he started on  his way feeling quite contented.    Having walked for an hour or two through the pretty country that is  ruled by King Bud, Kiki Aru decided he could travel faster and see more  as a bird, so he transformed himself into a white dove and visited the  great city of Nole and saw the King's palace and gardens and many other  places of interest.  Then he flew westward into the Kingdom of Ix, and  after a day in Queen Zixi's country went on westward into the Land of  Ev.  Every place he visited he thought was much more pleasant than the  saucer-country of the Hyups, and he decided that when he reached the  finest country of all he would settle there and enjoy his future life  to the utmost.    In the land of Ev he resumed his own shape again, for the cities and  villages were close together and he could easily go on foot from one to 
"Can you really do such wonderful transformations?" asked the old Nome,  looking at him curiously.    "Of course," declared Kiki.  "I can transform you into a stick of wood,  in a flash, or into a stone, and leave you here by the roadside."    "The wicked Nome shivered a little when he heard that, but it made him  long more than ever to possess the great secret.  After a while he said:    "I'll tell you what I'll do.  If you will help me to conquer Oz and to  transform the Oz people, who are my enemies, into sticks or stones, by  telling me your secret, I'll agree to make YOU the Ruler of all Oz, and  I will be your Prime Minister and see that your orders are obeyed."    "I'll help do that," said Kiki, "but I won't tell you my secret."    The Nome was so furious at this refusal that he jumped up and down with  rage and spluttered and choked for a long time before he could control  his passion.  But the boy was not at all frightened.  He laughed at the  wicked old Nome, which made him more furious than ever.    "Let's give up the idea," he proposed, when Ruggedo had quieted  somewhat.  "I don't know the Oz people you mention and so they are not  my enemies.  If they've kicked you out of your kingdom, that's your  affair--not mine."    "Wouldn't you like to be king of that splendid fairyland?" asked  Ruggedo.    "Yes, I would," replied Kiki Aru; "but you want to be king yourself,  and we would quarrel over it."    "No," said the Nome, trying to deceive him.  "I don't care to be King  of Oz, come to think it over.  I don't even care to live in that  country.  What I want first is revenge.  If we can conquer Oz, I'll get  enough magic then to conquer my own Kingdom of the Nomes, and I'll go  back and live in my underground caverns, which are more home-like than  the top of the earth.  So here's my proposition: Help me conquer Oz and 
     There is no other country so beautiful as the Land of Oz.  There are no  other people so happy and contented and prosperous as the Oz people.  They have all they desire; they love and admire their beautiful girl  Ruler, Ozma of Oz, and they mix work and play so justly that both are  delightful and satisfying and no one has any reason to complain.  Once  in a while something happens in Oz to disturb the people's happiness  for a brief time, for so rich and attractive a fairyland is sure to  make a few selfish and greedy outsiders envious, and therefore certain  evil-doers have treacherously plotted to conquer Oz and enslave its  people and destroy its girl Ruler, and so gain the wealth of Oz for  themselves.  But up to the time when the cruel and crafty Nome,  Ruggedo, conspired with Kiki Aru, the Hyup, all such attempts had  failed.  The Oz people suspected no danger.  Life in the world's nicest  fairyland was one round of joyous, happy days.    In the center of the Emerald City of Oz, the capital city of Ozma's  dominions, is a vast and beautiful garden, surrounded by a wall inlaid  with shining emeralds, and in the center of this garden stands Ozma's  Royal Palace, the most splendid building ever constructed.  From a  hundred towers and domes floated the banners of Oz, which included the  Ozmies, the Munchkins, the Gillikins, the Winkies and the Quadlings.  The banner of the Munchkins is blue, that of the Winkies yellow; the  Gillikin banner is purple, and the Quadling's banner is red.  The  colors of the Emerald City are of course green.  Ozma's own banner has  a green center, and is divided into four quarters.  These quarters are  colored blue, purple, yellow and red, indicating that she rules over  all the countries of the Land of Oz.    This fairyland is so big, however, that all of it is not yet known to  its girl Ruler, and it is said that in some far parts of the country,  in forests and mountain fastnesses, in hidden valleys and thick  jungles, are people and beasts that know as little about Ozma as she 
Ozma dear!"      "How do you like it, Dorothy?" inquired the Patchwork Girl.    "Is it good poetry, Scraps?" asked Dorothy, doubtfully.    "It's as good as any ordinary song," was the reply.  "I have given it a  dandy title, too.  I shall call the song: 'When Ozma Has a Birthday,  Everybody's Sure to Be Gay, for She Cannot Help the Fact That She Was  Born.'"    "That's a pretty long title, Scraps," said Dorothy.    "That makes it stylish," replied the Patchwork Girl, turning a  somersault and alighting on one stuffed foot. "Now-a-days the titles  are sometimes longer than the songs."    Dorothy left her and walked slowly toward the place, where she met the  Tin Woodman just going up the front steps.    "What are you going to give Ozma on her birthday?" she asked.    "It's a secret, but I'll tell you," replied the Tin Woodman, who was  Emperor of the Winkies.  "I am having my people make Ozma a lovely  girdle set with beautiful tin nuggets.  Each tin nugget will be  surrounded by a circle of emeralds, just to set it off to good  advantage.  The clasp of the girdle will be pure tin!  Won't that be  fine?"    "I'm sure she'll like it," said Dorothy.  "Do you know what I can give  her?"    "I haven't the slightest idea, Dorothy.  It took me three months to  think of my own present for Ozma."    The girl walked thoughtfully around to the back of the palace, and  presently came upon the famous Scarecrow of Oz, who has having two of  the palace servants stuff his legs with fresh straw.    "What are you going to give Ozma on her birthday?" asked Dorothy.    "I want to surprise her," answered the Scarecrow.    "I won't tell," promised Dorothy.    "Well, I'm having some straw slippers made for her--all straw, mind  you, and braided very artistically.  Ozma has always admired my straw  filling, so I'm sure she'll be pleased with these lovely straw  slippers."  
 "That's where you're to help me," said Dorothy.  "In some of those wild  forests in the Gillikin Country are lots of monkeys."    "Big ones," said the Wizard.    "Well, you and I will go there, and we'll get some of the big monkeys,  and you will make them small--just three inches high--by means of your  magic, and we'll put the little monkeys all in a basket and bring them  home with us.  Then you'll train them to dance--up here in your room,  where no one can see them--and on Ozma's birthday we'll put 'em into  the cake and they'll know by that time just what to do."    The Wizard looked at Dorothy with admiring approval, and chuckled again.    "That's really clever, my dear," he said, "and I see no reason why we  can't do it, just the way you say, if only we can get the wild monkeys  to agree to it."    "Do you think they'll object?" asked the girl.    "Yes; but perhaps we can argue them into it.  Anyhow it's worth trying,  and I'll help you if you'll agree to let this Surprise Cake be a  present to Ozma from you and me together.  I've been wondering what I  could give Ozma, and as I've got to train the monkeys as well as make  them small, I think you ought to make me your partner."    "Of course," said Dorothy; "I'll be glad to do so."    "Then it's a bargain," declared the Wizard.  "We must go to seek those  monkeys at once, however, for it will take time to train them and we'll  have to travel a good way to the Gillikin forests where they live."    "I'm ready to go any time," agreed Dorothy.  "Shall we ask Ozma to let  us take the Sawhorse?"    The Wizard did not answer that at once.  He took time to think of the  suggestion.    "No," he answered at length, "the Red Wagon couldn't get through the  thick forests and there's some danger to us in going into the wild  places to search for monkeys.  So I propose we take the Cowardly Lion 
"Silence!" growled Gugu the King, and Loo obeyed, although still  trembling with wrath.  The cold, steady gaze of the Leopard wandered  over the two strange beasts.  "The people of Oz," said he, "have not  been our friends; they have not been our enemies.  They have let us  alone, and we have let them alone.  There is no reason for war between  us.  They have no slaves.  They could not use us as slaves if they  should conquer us.  I think you are telling us lies, you strange  Li-Mon-Eag--you mixed-up beast who are neither one thing nor another."    "Oh, on my word, it's the truth!" protested the Nome in the beast's  shape.  "I wouldn't lie for the world; I--"    "Silence!" again growled Gugu the King; and somehow, even Ruggedo was  abashed and obeyed the edict.    "What do you say, Bru?" asked the King, turning to the great Bear, who  had until now said nothing.    "How does the Mixed Beast know that what he says is true?" asked the  Bear.    "Why, I can fly, you know, having the wings of an Eagle," explained the  Nome.  "I and my comrade yonder," turning to Kiki, "flew to a grove in  Oz, and there we heard the people telling how they will make many ropes  to snare you beasts, and then they will surround this forest, and all  other forests, and make you prisoners.  So we came here to warn you,  for being beasts ourselves, although we live in the sky, we are your  friends."    The Leopard's lip curled and showed his enormous teeth, sharp as  needles.  He turned to the Gray Ape.    "What do YOU think, Rango?" he asked.    "Send these mixed beasts away, Your Majesty," replied the Gray Ape.  "They are mischief-makers."    "Don't do that--don't do that!" cried the Unicorn, nervously.  "The  stranger said he would tell us what to do.  Let him tell us, then.  Are  we fools, not to heed a warning?"    Gugu the King turned to Ruggedo.    "Speak, Stranger," he commanded.  
   Suddenly the blue-green leaves of the trees changed to a purple hue,  and Trot noticed this and said:    "I wonder what made the colors change like that?"    "It's because we have left the Munchkin Country and entered the  Gillikin Country," explained the Glass Cat.  "Also it's a sign our  journey is nearly ended."    The river made a sudden turn, and after the travelers had passed around  the bend, they saw that the stream had now become as broad as a small  lake, and in the center of the Lake they beheld a little island, not  more than fifty feet in extent, either way.  Something glittered in the  middle of this tiny island, and the Glass Cat paused on the bank and  said:    "There is the gold flower-pot containing the Magic Flower, which is  very curious and beautiful.  If you can get to the island, your task is  ended--except to carry the thing home with you."    Cap'n Bill looked at the broad expanse of water and began to whistle a  low, quavering tune.  Trot knew that the whistle meant that Cap'n Bill  was thinking, and the old sailor didn't look at the island as much as  he looked at the trees upon the bank where they stood.  Presently he  took from the big pocket of his coat an axe-blade, wound in an old  cloth to keep the sharp edge from cutting his clothing.  Then, with a  large pocket knife, he cut a small limb from a tree and whittled it  into a handle for his axe.    "Sit down, Trot," he advised the girl, as he worked.  "I've got quite a  job ahead of me now, for I've got to build us a raft."    "What do we need a raft for, Cap'n?"    "Why, to take us to the island.  We can't walk under water, in the  river bed, as the Glass Cat did, so we must float atop the water."    "Can you make a raft, Cap'n Bill?"    "O' course, Trot, if you give me time."    The little girl sat down on a log and gazed at the Island of the Magic 
"This is funny!" she exclaimed. "What do you 'spose has happened to us,  Cap'n Bill?"    "I'm tryin' to make out," he answered.  "Take off your shoes, Trot.  P'raps it's the leather soles that's stuck to the ground."    She leaned down and unlaced her shoes, but found she could not pull her  feet out of them.  The Glass Cat, which was walking around as naturally  as ever, now said:    "Your foot has got roots to it, Cap'n, and I can see the roots going  into the ground, where they spread out in all directions.  It's the  same way with Trot.  That's why you can't move.  The roots hold you  fast."    Cap'n Bill was rather fat and couldn't see his own feet very well, but  he squatted down and examined Trot's feet and decided that the Glass  Cat was right.    "This is hard luck," he declared, in a voice that showed he was uneasy  at the discovery.  "We're pris'ners, Trot, on this funny island, an'  I'd like to know how we're ever goin' to get loose, so's we can get  home again."    "Now I know why the Kalidah laughed at us," said the girl, "and why he  said none of the beasts ever came to this island.  The horrid creature  knew we'd be caught, and wouldn't warn us."    In the meantime, the Kalidah, although pinned fast to the earth by  Cap'n Bill's stake, was facing the island, and now the ugly expression  which passed over its face when it defied and sneered at Cap'n Bill and  Trot, had changed to one of amusement and curiosity.  When it saw the  adventurers had actually reached the island and were standing beside  the Magic Flower, it heaved a breath of satisfaction--a long, deep  breath that swelled its deep chest until the beast could feel the stake  that held him move a little, as if withdrawing itself from the ground.    "Ah ha!" murmured the Kalidah, "a little more of this will set me free  and allow me to escape!"    So he began breathing as hard as he could, puffing out his chest as 
   When the stranger ceased speaking, a great silence fell on the  assemblage, for the beasts were thinking of what he had said.  Finally  one of the walruses asked:    "Can you really transform beasts into men, and men into beasts?"    "He can--he can!" cried Loo the Unicorn, prancing up and down in an  excited manner.  "He transformed ME, only last evening, and he can  transform us all."    Gugu the King now stepped forward.    "You have heard the stranger speak," said he, "and now you must answer  him.  It is for you to decide.  Shall we agree to this plan, or not?"    "Yes!" shouted some of the animals.    "No!" shouted others.    And some were yet silent.    Gugu looked around the great circle.    "Take more time to think," he suggested.  "Your answer is very  important.  Up to this time we have had no trouble with the Oz people,  but we are proud and free, and never will become slaves.  Think  carefully, and when you are ready to answer, I will hear you."          12.  Kiki Uses His Magic      Then arose a great confusion of sounds as all the animals began talking  to their fellows.  The monkeys chattered and the bears growled and the  voices of the jaguars and lions rumbled, and the wolves yelped and the  elephants had to trumpet loudly to make their voices heard.  Such a  hubbub had never been known in the forest before, and each beast argued  with his neighbor until it seemed the noise would never cease.    Ruggedo the Nome waved his arms and fluttered his wings to try to make  them listen to him again, but the beasts paid no attention.  Some  wanted to fight the Oz people, some wanted to be transformed, and some  wanted to do nothing at all.    The growling and confusion had grown greater than ever when in a flash  silence fell on all the beasts present, the arguments were hushed, and  all gazed in astonishment at a strange sight. 
  "I'm the Hungry Tiger," said the Rabbit.    "I'm Gugu the King," said the fat Woman.    But when they asked the Goose who he was, Ruggedo the Nome would not  tell them.    "I'm just a Goose," he replied, "and what I was before, I cannot  remember."          13.  The Loss of the Black Bag      Kiki Aru, in the form of the Li-Mon-Eag, had scrambled into the high,  thick branches of the tree, so no one could see him, and there he  opened the Wizard's black bag, which he had carried away in his flight.  He was curious to see what the Wizard's magic tools looked like, and  hoped he could use some of them and so secure more power; but after he  had taken the articles, one by one, from the bag, he had to admit they  were puzzles to him.  For, unless he understood their uses, they were  of no value whatever.  Kiki Aru, the Hyup boy, was no wizard or  magician at all, and could do nothing unusual except to use the Magic  Word he had stolen from his father on Mount Munch.  So he hung the  Wizard's black bag on a branch of the tree and then climbed down to the  lower limbs that he might see what the victims of his transformations  were doing.    They were all on top of the flat rock, talking together in tones so low  that Kiki could not hear what they said.    "This is certainly a misfortune," remarked the Wizard in the Fox's  form, "but our transformations are a sort of enchantment which is very  easy to break--when you know how and have the tools to do it with.  The  tools are in my Black Bag; but where is the Bag?"    No one knew that, for none had seen Kiki Aru fly away with it.    "Let's look and see if we can find it," suggested Dorothy the Lamb.    So they left the rock, and all of them searched the clearing high and  low without finding the Bag of Magic Tools.  The Goose searched as 
   "I'm the Hungry Tiger," said the Rabbit.    "I'm Gugu, King of the Forest," said the fat Woman.    The Glass Cat sat on its hind legs and began to laugh.  "My, what a  funny lot!" exclaimed the Creature.  "Who played this joke on you?"    "It's no joke at all," declared the Wizard.  "It was a cruel, wicked  transformation, and the Magician that did it has the head of a lion,  the body of a monkey, the wings of an eagle and a round ball on the end  of his tail."    The Glass Cat laughed again.  "That Magician must look funnier than you  do," it said.  "Where is he now?"    "Somewhere in the forest," said the Cowardly Lion.  "He just jumped  into that tall maple tree over there, for he can climb like a monkey  and fly like an eagle, and then he disappeared in the forest."    "And there was another Magician, just like him, who was his friend,"  added Dorothy, "but they probably quarreled, for the wickedest one  changed his friend into the form of a Goose."    "What became of the Goose?" asked the Cat, looking around.    "He must have gone away to find his friend," answered Gugu the King.  "But a Goose can't travel very fast, so we could easily find him if we  wanted to."    "The worst thing of all," said the Wizard, "is that my Black Bag is  lost.  It disappeared when I was transformed.  If I could find it I  could easily break these enchantments by means of my magic, and we  would resume our own forms again.  Will you help us search for the  Black Bag, Friend Cat?"    "Of course," replied the Glass Cat.  "But I expect the strange Magician  carried it away with him.  If he's a magician, he knows you need that  Bag, and perhaps he's afraid of your magic.  So he's probably taken the  Bag with him, and you won't see it again unless you find the Magician."    "That sounds reasonable," remarked the Lamb, which was Dorothy.  "Those 
pronounced.  But he sat still in the hollow and waited to hear it  again, so it would be impressed on his mind and he would not forget it.    Kiki kept running to the edge of the forest and back to the hollow tree  again until he had whispered the Magic Word six times and six monkeys  had been changed to six great Giants.  Then the Wizard decided he would  make an experiment and use the Magic Word himself.  So, while Kiki was  running back to the Nome, the Fox stuck his head out of the hollow and  said softly: "I want that creature who is running to become a  hickory-nut--Pyrzqxgl!"    Instantly the Li-Mon-Eag form of Kiki Aru the Hyup disappeared and a  small hickory-nut rolled upon the ground a moment and then lay still.    The Wizard was delighted, and leaped from the hollow just as Ruggedo  looked around to see what had become of Kiki.  The Nome saw the Fox but  no Kiki, so he hastily rose to his feet.  The Wizard did not know how  powerful the queer beast might be, so he resolved to take no chances.    "I want this creature to become a walnut--Pyrzqxgl!" he said aloud.  But he did not pronounce the Magic Word in quite the right way, and  Ruggedo's form did not change.  But the Nome knew at once that  "Pyrzqxgl!" was the Magic Word, so he rushed at the Fox and cried:    "I want you to become a Goose--Pyrzqxgl!"    But the Nome did not pronounce the word aright, either, having never  heard it spoken but once before, and then with a wrong accent.  So the  Fox was not transformed, but it had to run away to escape being caught  by the angry Nome.    Ruggedo now began pronouncing the Magic Word in every way he could  think of, hoping to hit the right one, and the Fox, hiding in a bush,  was somewhat troubled by the fear that he might succeed.  However, the  Wizard, who was used to magic arts, remained calm and soon remembered  exactly how Kiki Aru had pronounced the word.  So he repeated the 
   "I'm the Lonesome Duck," replied the bird.  "I suppose you've heard of  me?"    "No," said Trot, "I can't say I have.  What makes you lonesome?"    "Why, I haven't any family or any relations," returned the Duck.    "Haven't you any friends?"    "Not a friend.  And I've nothing to do.  I've lived a long time, and  I've got to live forever, because I belong in the Land of Oz, where no  living thing dies.  Think of existing year after year, with no friends,  no family, and nothing to do!  Can you wonder I'm lonesome?"    "Why don't you make a few friends, and find something to do?" inquired  Cap'n Bill.    "I can't make friends because everyone I meet--bird, beast, or  person--is disagreeable to me.  In a few minutes I shall be unable to  bear your society longer, and then I'll go away and leave you," said  the Lonesome Duck.  "And, as for doing anything, there's no use in it.  All I meet are doing something, so I have decided it's common and  uninteresting and I prefer to remain lonesome."    "Don't you have to hunt for your food?" asked Trot.    "No.  In my diamond palace, a little way up the river, food is  magically supplied me; but I seldom eat, because it is so common."    "You must be a Magician Duck," remarked Cap'n Bill.    "Why so?"    "Well, ordinary ducks don't have diamond palaces an' magic food, like  you do."    "True; and that's another reason why I'm lonesome.  You must remember  I'm the only Duck in the Land of Oz, and I'm not like any other duck in  the outside world."    "Seems to me you LIKE bein' lonesome," observed Cap'n Bill.    "I can't say I like it, exactly," replied the Duck, "but since it seems  to be my fate, I'm rather proud of it."    "How do you s'pose a single, solitary Duck happened to be in the Land  of Oz?" asked Trot, wonderingly.    "I used to know the reason, many years ago, but I've quite forgotten 
bag."    "If I find it, will you go to them?" asked the creature.    "Of course," replied the Wizard.  "But I do not think that a Glass Cat  with nothing but pink brains can succeed when all the rest of us have  failed."    "Don't you admire my pink brains?" demanded the Cat.    "They're pretty," admitted the Wizard, "but they're not regular brains,  you know, and so we don't expect them to amount to much."    "But if I find your black bag--and find it inside of five minutes--will  you admit my pink brains are better than your common human brains?"    "Well, I'll admit they're better HUNTERS," said the Wizard,  reluctantly, "but you can't do it.  We've searched everywhere, and the  black bag isn't to be found."    "That shows how much you know!" retorted the Glass Cat, scornfully.  "Watch my brains a minute, and see them whirl around."    The Wizard watched, for he was anxious to regain his black bag, and the  pink brains really did whirl around in a remarkable manner.    "Now, come with me," commanded the Glass Cat, and led the Wizard  straight to the spot where it had covered the bag with leaves.  "According to my brains," said the creature, "your black bag ought to  be here."    Then it scratched at the leaves and uncovered the bag, which the Wizard  promptly seized with a cry of delight.  Now that he had regained his  Magic Tools, he felt confident he could rescue Trot and Cap'n Bill.    Rango the Gray Ape was getting impatient.  He now approached the Wizard  and said:    "Well, what do you intend to do about those poor enchanted monkeys?"    "I'll make a bargain with you, Rango," replied the little man.  "If you  will let me take a dozen of your monkeys to the Emerald City, and keep  them until after Ozma's birthday, I'll break the enchantment of the six  Giant Soldiers and return them to their natural forms."    But the Gray Ape shook his head.    "I can't do it," he declared.  "The monkeys would be very lonesome and 
 upon the ground.    The Wizard picked up the magic axe and after carefully wiping it with  his silk handkerchief put it away in his black bag.  Then they went on  and in a short time reached the river.    "Let me see," said the Glass Cat, looking up and down the stream, "I  think we are below the Magic Isle; so we must go up the stream until we  come to it."    So up the stream they traveled, walking comfortably on the river bank,  and after a while the water broadened and a sharp bend appeared in the  river, hiding all below from their view.  They walked briskly along,  however, and had nearly reached the bend when a voice cried warningly:  "Look out!"    The travelers halted abruptly and the Wizard said: "Look out for what?"    "You almost stepped on my Diamond Palace," replied the voice, and a  duck with gorgeously colored feathers appeared before them.  "Beasts  and men are terribly clumsy," continued the Duck in an irritated tone,  "and you've no business on this side of the River, anyway.  What are  you doing here?"    "We've come to rescue some friends of ours who are stuck fast on the  Magic Isle in this river," explained Dorothy.    "I know 'em," said the Duck.  "I've been to see 'em, and they're stuck  fast, all right.  You may as well go back home, for no power can save  them."    "This is the Wonderful Wizard of Oz," said Dorothy, pointing to the  little man.    "Well, I'm the Lonesome Duck," was the reply, as the fowl strutted up  and down to show its feathers to best advantage.  "I'm the great Forest  Magician, as any beast can tell you, but even I have no power to  destroy the dreadful charm of the Magic Isle."    "Are you lonesome because you're a magician?" inquired Dorothy.    "No; I'm lonesome because I have no family and no friends.  But I like  to be lonesome, so please don't offer to be friendly with me.  Go away,  and try not to step on my Diamond Palace." 
"What are you going to do with that?" asked Cap'n Bill.    "It's a magic axe," replied the Wizard, "and when I tell it to chop, it  will chop those roots from your feet and you can run to the raft before  they grow again."    "Don't!" shouted the sailor in alarm.  "Don't do it!  Those roots are  all flesh roots, and our bodies are feeding 'em while they're growing  into the ground."    "To cut off the roots," said Trot, "would be like cutting off our  fingers and toes."    The Wizard put the little axe back in the black bag and took out a pair  of silver pincers.    "Grow--grow--grow!" he said to the pincers, and at once they grew and  extended until they reached from the raft to the prisoners.    "What are you going to do now?" demanded Cap'n Bill, fearfully eyeing  the pincers.    "This magic tool will pull you up, roots and all, and land you on this  raft," declared the Wizard.    "Don't do it!" pleaded the sailor, with a shudder.  "It would hurt us  awfully."    "It would be just like pulling teeth to pull us up by the roots,"  explained Trot.    "Grow small!" said the Wizard to the pincers, and at once they became  small and he threw them into the black bag.    "I guess, friends, it's all up with us, this time," remarked Cap'n  Bill, with a dismal sigh.    "Please tell Ozma, Dorothy," said Trot, "that we got into trouble  trying to get her a nice birthday present.  Then she'll forgive us.  The Magic Flower is lovely and wonderful, but it's just a lure to catch  folks on this dreadful island and then destroy them.  You'll have a  nice birthday party, without us, I'm sure; and I hope, Dorothy, that  none of you in the Emerald City will forget me--or dear ol' Cap'n Bill."          19.  Dorothy and the Bumble Bees      Dorothy was greatly distressed and had hard work to keep the tears from  her eyes. 
   "Now," said the Wizard, "we must start for home.  But how are we going  to carry that big gold flower-pot?  Cap'n Bill can't lug it all the  way, that's certain."    "No," acknowledged the sailor-man; "it's pretty heavy.  I could carry  it for a little while, but I'd have to stop to rest every few minutes."    "Couldn't we put it on your back?" Dorothy asked the Cowardly Lion,  with a good-natured yawn.    "I don't object to carrying it, if you can fasten it on," answered the  Lion.    "If it falls off," said Trot, "it might get smashed an' be ruined."    "I'll fix it," promised Cap'n Bill.  "I'll make a flat board out of one  of these tree trunks, an' tie the board on the lion's back, an' set the  flower-pot on the board."  He set to work at once to do this, but as he  only had his big knife for a tool his progress was slow.    So the Wizard took from his black bag a tiny saw that shone like silver  and said to it:    "Saw, Little Saw, come show your power;  Make us a board for the Magic Flower."      And at once the Little Saw began to move and it sawed the log so fast  that those who watched it work were astonished.  It seemed to  understand, too, just what the board was to be used for, for when it  was completed it was flat on top and hollowed beneath in such a manner  that it exactly fitted the Lion's back.    "That beats whittlin'!" exclaimed Cap'n Bill, admiringly.  "You don't  happen to have TWO o' them saws; do you, Wizard?"    "No," replied the Wizard, wiping the Magic Saw carefully with his silk  handkerchief and putting it back in the black bag.  "It's the only saw  of its kind in the world; and if there were more like it, it wouldn't  be so wonderful."    They now tied the board on the Lion's back, flat side up, and Cap'n  Bill carefully placed the Magic Flower on the board. 
interesting case in her Throne Room, Cap'n Bill managed to carry the  golden flower-pot containing the Magic Flower up to Trot's room without  it being seen by anyone except Jellia Jamb, Ozma's chief Maid of Honor,  and Jellia promised not to tell.    Also the Wizard was able to carry the cage of monkeys up to one of the  top towers of the palace, where he had a room of his own, to which no  one came unless invited.  So Trot and Dorothy and Cap'n Bill and the  Wizard were all delighted at the successful end of their adventure.  The Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger went to the marble stables  behind the Royal Palace, where they lived while at home, and they too  kept the secret, even refusing to tell the Wooden Sawhorse, and Hank  the Mule, and the Yellow Hen, and the Pink Kitten where they had been.    Trot watered the Magic Flower every day and allowed no one in her room  to see the beautiful blossoms except her friends, Betsy Bobbin and  Dorothy.  The wonderful plant did not seem to lose any of its magic by  being removed from its island, and Trot was sure that Ozma would prize  it as one of her most delightful treasures.    Up in his tower the little Wizard of Oz began training his twelve tiny  monkeys, and the little creatures were so intelligent that they learned  every trick the Wizard tried to teach them.  The Wizard treated them  with great kindness and gentleness and gave them the food that monkeys  love best, so they promised to do their best on the great occasion of  Ozma's birthday.          22.  Ozma's Birthday Party      It seems odd that a fairy should have a birthday, for fairies, they  say, were born at the beginning of time and live forever.  Yet, on the  other hand, it would be a shame to deprive a fairy, who has so many  other good things, of the delights of a birthday.  So we need not  wonder that the fairies keep their birthdays just as other folks do,  and consider them occasions for feasting and rejoicing. 
 forget to give due credit to the Glass Cat and the little Wizard, but  it was really Cap'n Bill who had bravely carried the golden flower-pot  away from the enchanted Isle.    Ozma thanked them all, and said she would place the Magic Flower in her  boudoir where she might enjoy its beauty and fragrance continually.  But now she discovered the marvelous gown woven by Glinda and her  maidens from strands drawn from pure emeralds, and being a girl who  loved pretty clothes, Ozma's ecstasy at being presented with this  exquisite gown may well be imagined.  She could hardly wait to put it  on, but the table was loaded with other pretty gifts and the night was  far spent before the happy girl Ruler had examined all her presents and  thanked those who had lovingly donated them.          23.  The Fountain of Oblivion      The morning after the birthday fete, as the Wizard and Dorothy were  walking in the grounds of the palace, Ozma came out and joined them,  saying:    "I want to hear more of your adventures in the Forest of Gugu, and how  you were able to get those dear little monkeys to use in Dorothy's  Surprise Cake."    So they sat down on a marble bench near to the Fountain of the Water of  Oblivion, and between them Dorothy and the Wizard related their  adventures.    "I was dreadfully fussy while I was a woolly lamb," said Dorothy, "for  it didn't feel good, a bit.  And I wasn't quite sure, you know, that  I'd ever get to be a girl again."    "You might have been a woolly lamb yet, if I hadn't happened to have  discovered that Magic Transformation Word," declared the Wizard.    "But what became of the walnut and the hickory-nut into which you  transformed those dreadful beast magicians?" inquired Ozma.    "Why, I'd almost forgotten them," was the reply; "but I believe they  are still here in my pocket."    Then he searched in his pockets and brought out the two nuts and showed  them to her.
