meant to remain so. Mr. Scroope exclaimed that she might so far as he  was concerned. She answered that she never wished to see his face again.  He declared with emphasis that she never should and that he was going to  Africa to shoot elephants.    What is more, he went, starting from his Essex home the next day without  leaving any address. As it transpired afterwards, long afterwards, had  he waited till the post came in he would have received a letter that  might have changed his plans. But they were high-spirited young people,  both of them, and played the fool after the fashion of those in love.    Well, Charles Scroope turned up in Durban, which was but a poor place  then, and there we met in the bar of the Royal Hotel.    “If you want to kill big game,” I heard some one say, who it was  I really forget, “there’s the man to show you how to do it--Hunter  Quatermain; the best shot in Africa and one of the finest fellows, too.”    I sat still, smoking my pipe and pretending to hear nothing. It is  awkward to listen to oneself being praised, and I was always a shy man.    Then after a whispered colloquy Mr. Scroope was brought forward and  introduced to me. I bowed as nicely as I could and ran my eye over him.  He was a tall young man with dark eyes and a rather romantic aspect  (that was due to his love affair), but I came to the conclusion that I  liked the cut of his jib. When he spoke, that conclusion was affirmed. I  always think there is a great deal in a voice; personally, I judge by it  almost as much as by the face. This voice was particularly pleasant and  sympathetic, though there was nothing very original or striking in the  words by which it was, so to speak, introduced to me. These were:    “How do you do, sir. Will you have a split?”    I answered that I never drank spirits in the daytime, or at least not  often, but that I should be pleased to take a small bottle of beer. 
 Central East Africa which are said to bite off men’s toes and fingers. I  have heard too that they are very like gorillas.”    “Now you mention it, so have I, Allan. Indeed, once I saw a _soko_,  though some way off, a huge, brown ape which stood on its hind legs and  drummed upon its chest with its fists. I didn’t see it for long because  I ran away.”    “The third is that this yellow orchid would be worth a great deal of  money if one could dig it up and take it to England.”    “I think I told you, Allan, that I valued it at £20,000, so that  conclusion of yours is not original.”    “The fourth is that I should like to dig up that orchid and get a share  of the £20,000.”    Brother John became intensely interested.    “Ah!” he said, “now we are getting to the point. I have been wondering  how long it would take you to see it, Allan, but if you are slow, you  are sure.”    “The fifth is,” I went on, “that such an expedition to succeed would  need a great deal of money, more than you or I could find. Partners  would be wanted, active or sleeping, but partners with cash.”    Brother John looked towards the window of the room in which Charlie  Scroope was in bed, for being still weak he went to rest early.    “No,” I said, “he’s had enough of Africa, and you told me yourself that  it will be two years before he is really strong again. Also there’s a  lady in this case. Now listen. I have taken it on myself to write to  that lady, whose address I found out while he didn’t know what he was  saying. I have said that he was dying, but that I hoped he might live.  Meanwhile, I added, I thought she would like to know that he did nothing  but rave of her; also that he was a hero, with a big H twice underlined.  My word! I did lay it on about the hero business with a spoon, a real  hotel gravy spoon. If Charlie Scroope knows himself again when he sees 
  “Nineteen, sir,” said Woodden in a stony voice.    “Two thousand,” echoed the gentleman with the long beard.    “Twenty-one hundred,” said Woodden.    “That’s right, Mr. Woodden,” cried Mr. Primrose, “you are indeed  representing your principal worthily. I feel sure that you do not mean  to stop for a few miserable pounds.”    “Not if I knows it,” ejaculated Woodden. “I has my orders and I acts up  to them.”    “Twenty-two hundred,” said Long-beard.    “Twenty-three,” echoed Woodden.    “Oh, damn!” shouted Long-beard and rushed from the room.    “‘Odontoglossum Pavo’ is going for twenty-three hundred, only  twenty-tree hundred,” cried the auctioneer. “Any advance on twenty-three  hundred? What? None? Then I must do my duty. One. Two. For the last  time--no advance? Three. Gone to Mr. Woodden, bidding for his principal,  Mr. Somers.”    The hammer fell with a sharp tap, and at this moment my young friend  sauntered into the room.    “Well, Woodden,” he said, “have they put the ‘Pavo’ up yet?”    “It’s up and it’s down, sir. I’ve bought him right enough.”    “The deuce you have! What did it fetch?”    Woodden scratched his head.    “I don’t rightly know, sir, never was good at figures, not having much  book learning, but it’s twenty-three something.”    “£23? No, it would have brought more than that. By Jingo! it must be  £230. That’s pretty stiff, but still, it may be worth it.”    At this moment Mr. Primrose, who, leaning over his desk, was engaged in  animated conversation with an excited knot of orchid fanciers, looked  up:    “Oh! there you are, Mr. Somers,” he said. “In the name of all this  company let me congratulate you on having become the owner of the  matchless ‘Odontoglossum Pavo’ for what, under all the circumstances, I  consider the quite moderate price of £2,300.”    Really that young man took it very well. He shivered slightly and turned  a little pale, that is all. Woodden rocked to and fro like a tree about  to fall. I and my tin box collapsed together in the corner. Yes, I was 
 stood, and so I think did his son, though he never showed me the letter.    At Durban, just as we were about to start up country, I received an  answer from him, sent by some boat that followed us very closely. In  it he said that he quite understood the position, and whatever happened  would attribute no blame to me, whom he should always regard with  friendly feelings. He told me that, in the event of any difficulty or  want of money, I was to draw on him for whatever might be required, and  that he had advised the African Bank to that effect. Further, he added,  that at least his son had shown grit in this matter, for which he  respected him.    And now for a long while I must bid good-bye to Sir Alexander Somers and  all that has to do with England.          CHAPTER IV    MAVOVO AND HANS    We arrived safely at Durban at the beginning of March and took up our  quarters at my house on the Berea, where I expected that Brother John  would be awaiting us. But no Brother John was to be found. The old, lame  Griqua, Jack, who looked after the place for me and once had been one of  my hunters, said that shortly after I went away in the ship, Dogeetah,  as he called him, had taken his tin box and his net and walked off  inland, he knew not where, leaving, as he declared, no message or letter  behind him. The cases full of butterflies and dried plants were also  gone, but these, I found he had shipped to some port in America, by a  sailing vessel bound for the United States which chanced to put in at  Durban for food and water. As to what had become of the man himself I  could get no clue. He had been seen at Maritzburg and, according to some  Kaffirs whom I knew, afterwards on the borders of Zululand, where, so  
Such in brief was Sammy.    As he entered the room I saw that his clothes were very wet and asked  him at once if it were raining, or whether he had got drunk and been  sleeping in the damp grass.    “No, Mr. Quatermain,” he answered, “the morning is extremely fine, and  like the poor Hottentot, Hans, I have abjured the use of intoxicants.  Though we differ on much else, in this matter we agree.”    “Then what the deuce is up?” I interrupted, to cut short his flow of  fine language.    “Sir, there is trouble on the ship” (remembering Mavovo I started at  these words) “where I passed the night in the company of Mr. Somers at  his special request.” (It was the other way about really.) “This  morning before the dawn, when he thought that everybody was asleep, the  Portuguese captain and some of his Arabs began to weigh the anchor quite  quietly; also to hoist the sails. But Mr. Somers and I, being very much  awake, came out of the cabin and he sat upon the capstan with a revolver  in his hand, saying--well, sir, I will not repeat what he said.”    “No, don’t. What happened then?”    “Then, sir, there followed much noise and confusion. The Portugee and  the Arabs threatened Mr. Somers, but he, sir, continued to sit upon  the capstan with the stern courage of a rock in a rushing stream, and  remarked that he would see them all somewhere before they touched it.  After this, sir, I do not know what occurred, since while I watched from  the bulwarks someone knocked me head over heels into the sea and being  fortunately, a good swimmer, I gained the shore and hurried here to  advise you.”    “And did you advise anyone else, you idiot?” I asked.    “Yes, sir. As I sped along I communicated to an officer of the port that  there was the devil of a mess upon the _Maria_ which he would do well to  investigate.”    By this time I was in my shirt and trousers and shouting to Mavovo and  the others. Soon they arrived, for as the costume of Mavovo and his 
 too, an Arab rushed up from the shore, crying:    “Where is the Bey Hassan?”    “Here,” I said, pointing at him.    The Arab stared until I thought his eyes would drop out, for the Bey  Hassan was indeed a sight to see. Then he gabbled in a frightened voice:    “Captain, an English man-of-war is chasing the _Maria_.”    Boom went the great gun for the second time. Hassan said nothing, but  his jaw dropped, and I saw that he had lost exactly three teeth.    “That is the _Crocodile_,” I remarked slowly, causing Sammy to  translate, and as I spoke, produced from my inner pocket a Union Jack  which I had placed there after I heard that the ship was sighted.  “Stephen,” I went on as I shook it out, “if you have got your wind,  would you mind climbing up that palm tree again and signalling with this  to the _Crocodile_ out at sea?”    “By George! that’s a good idea,” said Stephen, whose jovial face,  although swollen, was now again wreathed in smiles. “Hans, bring me a  long stick and a bit of string.”    But Hassan did not think it at all a good idea.    “English lord,” he gasped, “you shall have the bearers. I will go to  fetch them.”    “No, you won’t,” I said, “you will stop here as a hostage. Send that  man.”    Hassan uttered some rapid orders and the messenger sped away, this time  towards the stockaded village on the right.    As he went another messenger arrived, who also stared amazedly at the  condition of his chief.    “Bey--if you are the Bey,” he said, in a doubtful voice, for by now  the amiable face of Hassan had begun to swell and colour, “with the  telescope we have seen that the English man-of-war has sent a boat and  boarded the _Maria_.”    “God is great!” muttered the discomfited Hassan, “and Delgado, who is a  thief and a traitor from his mother’s breast, will tell the truth. The  English sons of Satan will land here. All is finished; nothing is left 
and yet, my father, in this case my heart is against it. Hans” (he  called him _Inblatu_, a Zulu word which means Spotted Snake, that was  the Hottentot’s Kaffir name) “says that there are quite sixty of the  yellow dogs, all armed with guns, whereas we have not more than fifteen,  for we cannot trust the slave men. Also he says that they are within a  strong fence and awake, with spies out, so that it will be difficult to  surprise them. But here, father, we are in a strong fence and cannot be  surprised. Also men who torture and kill women and children, except in  war must, I think, be cowards, and will come on faintly against good  shooting, if indeed they come at all. Therefore, I say, ‘Wait till  the buffalo shall either charge or run.’ But the word is with you,  Macumazana, wise Watcher-by-Night, not with me, your hunter. Speak, you  who are old in war, and I will obey.”    “You argue well,” I answered; “also another reason comes to my mind.  Those Arab brutes may get behind the slaves, of whom we should butcher  a lot without hurting them. Stephen, I think we had better see the thing  through here.”    “All right, Quatermain. Only I hope that Mavovo is wrong in thinking  that those blackguards may change their minds and run away.”    “Really, young man, you are becoming very blood-thirsty--for an orchid  grower,” I remarked, looking at him. “Now, for my part, I devoutly hope  that Mavovo is right, for let me tell you, if he isn’t it may be a nasty  job.”    “I’ve always been peaceful enough up to the present,” replied Stephen.  “But the sight of those unhappy wretches of slaves with their heads cut  open, and of the woman tied to a tree to starve----”    “Make you wish to usurp the functions of God Almighty,” I said. “Well,  it is a natural impulse and perhaps, in the circumstances, one that will  not displease Him. And now, as we have made up our minds what we are  going to do, let’s get to business so that these Arab gentlemen may find  their breakfast ready when they come to call.” 
 1,640 feet above sea level.    “What place is this?” I asked of the two Mazitu guides, those same men  whom we had borrowed from Hassan.    “The land of our people, Chief,” they answered, “which is bordered on  one side by the bush and on the other by the great lake where live the  Pongo wizards.”    I looked about me at the bare uplands that already were beginning to  turn brown, on which nothing was visible save vast herds of buck such as  were common further south. A dreary prospect it was, for a slight rain  was falling, accompanied by mist and a cold wind.    “I do not see your people or their kraals,” I said; “I only see grass  and wild game.”    “Our people will come,” they replied, rather nervously. “No doubt even  now their spies watch us from among the tall grass or out of some hole.”    “The deuce they do,” I said, or something like it, and thought no more  of the matter. When one is in conditions in which anything _may_ happen,  such as, so far as I am concerned, have prevailed through most of my  life, one grows a little careless as to what _will_ happen. For my part  I have long been a fatalist, to a certain extent. I mean I believe that  the individual, or rather the identity which animates him, came out from  the Source of all life a long while, perhaps hundreds of thousands or  millions of years ago, and when his career is finished, perhaps hundreds  of thousands or millions of years hence, or perhaps to-morrow, will  return perfected, but still as an individual, to dwell in or with that  Source of Life. I believe also that his various existences, here or  elsewhere, are fore-known and fore-ordained, although in a sense he may  shape them by the action of his free will, and that nothing which he can  do will lengthen or shorten one of them by a single hour. Therefore, so  far as I am concerned, I have always acted up to the great injunction of  our Master and taken no thought for the morrow.    
fortified in a way. That is, a tall, unclimbable palisade of timber  surrounded the entire town, which fence was strengthened by prickly  pears and cacti planted on its either side.    Within this palisade the town was divided into quarters more or  less devoted to various trades. Thus one part of it was called the  Ironsmiths’ Quarter; another the Soldiers’ Quarter; another the Quarter  of the Land-tillers; another that of the Skin-dressers, and so on. The  king’s dwelling and those of his women and dependents were near the  North gate, and in front of these, surrounded by semi-circles of huts,  was a wide space into which cattle could be driven if necessary. This,  however, at the time of our visit, was used as a market and a drilling  ground.    We entered the town, that must in all have contained a great number of  inhabitants, by the South gate, a strong log structure facing a wooded  slope through which ran a road. Just as the sun was setting we marched  to the guest-huts up a central street lined with the population of the  place who had gathered to stare at us. These huts were situated in the  Soldiers’ Quarter, not far from the king’s house and surrounded by an  inner fence to keep them private.    None of the people spoke as we passed them, for the Mazitu are polite by  nature; also it seemed to me that they regarded us with awe tempered  by curiosity. They only stared, and occasionally those of them who were  soldiers saluted us by lifting their spears. The huts into which we were  introduced by Babemba, with whom we had grown very friendly, were good  and clean.    Here all our belongings, including the guns which we had collected just  before the slaves ran away, were placed in one of the huts over which  a Mazitu mounted guard, the donkeys being tied to the fence at a little  distance. Outside this fence stood another armed Mazitu, also on guard.    “Are we prisoners here?” I asked of Babemba.    “The king watches over his guests,” he answered enigmatically. “Have  the white lords any message for the king whom I am summoned to see this 
   As a passage that I lit on described how the prophet Samuel for whom I  could not help reading “Imbozwi,” hewed Agag in pieces after Bausi--I  mean Saul--had relented and spared his life, I cannot say that it  consoled me very much. Doubtless, I reflected, these people believe that  I, like Agag, had “made women childless” by my sword, so there remained  nothing save to follow the example of that unhappy king and walk  “delicately” to doom.    Then, as Stephen was still sleeping--how _could_ he do it, I wondered--I  set to work to make up the accounts of the expedition to date. It had  already cost £1,423. Just fancy expending £1,423 in order to be tied to  a post and shot to death with arrows. And all to get a rare orchid! Oh!  I reflected to myself, if by some marvel I should escape, or if I should  live again in any land where these particular flowers flourish, I would  never even look at them. And as a matter of fact I never have.    At length Stephen did wake up and, as criminals are reported to do in  the papers before execution, made an excellent breakfast.    “What’s the good of worrying?” he said presently. “I shouldn’t if it  weren’t for my poor old father. It must have come to this one day, and  the sooner it is over the sooner to sleep, as the song says. When one  comes to think of it there are enormous advantages in sleep, for that’s  the only time one is quite happy. Still, I should have liked to see that  Cypripedium first.”    “Oh! drat the Cypripedium!” I exclaimed, and blundered from the hut to  tell Sammy that if he didn’t stop his groaning I would punch his head.    “Jumps! Regular jumps! Who’d have thought it of Quatermain?” I heard  Stephen mutter in the intervals of lighting his pipe.    The morning went “like lightning that is greased,” as Sammy remarked.  Three o’clock came and Mavovo and his following sacrificed a kid to  the spirits of their ancestors, which, as Sammy remarked again, was “a  horrible, heathen ceremony much calculated to prejudice our cause with 
“The blow knocked me senseless just about sunset one evening. When  I came to myself again it was broad daylight and everybody was gone,  except one old woman who was tending me. She was half-crazed with grief  because her husband and two sons had been killed, and another son, a  boy, and a daughter had been taken away. I asked her where my young wife  was. She answered that she, too, had been taken away eight or ten hours  before, because the Arabs had seen the lights of a ship out at sea, and  thought they might be those of a British man-of-war that was known to be  cruising on the coast. On seeing these they had fled inland in a hurry,  leaving me for dead, but killing the wounded before they went. The old  woman herself had escaped by hiding among some rocks on the seashore,  and after the Arabs had gone had crept back to the house and found me  still alive.    “I asked her where my wife had been taken. She said she did not know,  but some others of our people told her that they had heard the Arabs  say they were going to some place a hundred miles inland, to join their  leader, a half-bred villain named Hassan-ben-Mohammed, to whom they were  carrying my wife as a present.    “Now we knew this wretch, for after the Arabs landed at Kilwa, but  before actual hostilities broke out between us, he had fallen sick of  smallpox and my wife had helped to nurse him. Had it not been for her,  indeed, he would have died. However, although the leader of the band,  he was not present at the attack, being engaged in some slave-raiding  business in the interior.    “When I learned this terrible news, the shock of it, or the loss of  blood, brought on a return of insensibility, from which I only awoke  two days later to find myself on board a Dutch trading vessel that was  sailing for Zanzibar. It was the lights of this ship that the Arabs had  seen and mistaken for those of an English man-of-war. She had put into  Kilwa for water, and the sailors, finding me on the verandah of the 
   “I thought that the Kalubi was the priest of your gods,” interrupted  Bausi.    “Not so. The Kalubi is the King of the Pongo as you are the King of the  Mazitu. The Motombo, who is seldom seen, is King of the spirits and the  Mouth of the gods.”    Bausi nodded in the African fashion, that is by raising the chin, not  depressing it, and Komba went on:    “I have placed myself in your power, trusting to your honour. You can  kill me if you wish, though that will avail nothing, since there are  others waiting to become Kalubi in my place.”    “Am I a Pongo that I should wish to kill messengers and eat them?” asked  Bausi, with sarcasm, a speech at which I noticed the Pongo envoys winced  a little.    “King, you are mistaken. The Pongo only eat those whom the White God  has chosen. It is a religious rite. Why should they who have cattle in  plenty desire to devour men?”    “I don’t know,” grunted Bausi, “but there is one here who can tell a  different story,” and he looked at Babemba, who wriggled uncomfortably.    Komba also looked at him with his fierce eyes.    “It is not conceivable,” he said, “that anybody should wish to eat one  so old and bony, but let that pass. I thank you, King, for your promise  of safety. I have come here to ask that you should send envoys to confer  with the Kalubi and the Motombo, that a lasting peace may be arranged  between our peoples.”    “Why do not the Kalubi and the Motombo come here to confer?” asked  Bausi.    “Because it is not lawful that they should leave their land, O King.  Therefore they have sent me who am the Kalubi-to-come. Hearken. There  has been war between us for generations. It began so long ago that only  the Motombo knows of its beginning which he has from the gods. Once the  Pongo people owned all this land and only had their sacred places beyond  the water. Then your forefathers came and fell on them, killing many, 
pole that served as a mast was shipped, and a square sail, made of  closely-woven mats, run up. It filled with the morning off-land breeze  and presently we were bowling along at a rate of quite eight miles  the hour. The shore grew dim behind us, but for a long while above the  clinging mists I could see the flag that we had planted on the mound. By  degrees it dwindled till it became a mere speck and vanished. As it grew  smaller my spirits sank, and when it was quite gone, I felt very low  indeed.    Another of your fool’s errands, Allan my boy, I said to myself. I wonder  how many more you are destined to survive.    The others, too, did not seem in the best of spirits. Brother John  stared at the horizon, his lips moving as though he were engaged in  prayer, and even Stephen was temporarily depressed. Jerry had fallen  asleep, as a native generally does when it is warm and he has nothing  to do. Mavovo looked very thoughtful. I wondered whether he had been  consulting his Snake again, but did not ask him. Since the episode of  our escape from execution by bow and arrow I had grown somewhat afraid  of that unholy reptile. Next time it might foretell our immediate doom,  and if it did I knew that I should believe.    As for Hans, he looked much disturbed, and was engaged in wildly hunting  for something in the flap pockets of an antique corduroy waistcoat  which, from its general appearance, must, I imagine, years ago have  adorned the person of a British game-keeper.    “Three,” I heard him mutter. “By my great grandfather’s spirit! only  three left.”    “Three what?” I asked in Dutch.    “Three charms, Baas, and there ought to have been quite twenty-four. The  rest have fallen out through a hole that the devil himself made in this  rotten stuff. Now we shall not die of hunger, and we shall not be shot,  and we shall not be drowned, at least none of those things will happen  to me. But there are twenty-one other things that may finish us, as I 
 “I am sure I don’t know, Kalubi, but answer the rest of the question.”    “As to your coming into the forest--for the White God lives in a forest  on the slopes of the mountain, lords--that will be easy since the  Motombo and the people will believe that I am trapping you there to be a  sacrifice, such as they desire for sundry reasons,” and he looked at the  plump Stephen in a very suggestive way. “As to how you are to kill the  god without your tubes of iron, that I do not know. But you are very  brave and great magicians. Surely you can find a way.”    Here Brother John seemed to wake up again.    “Yes,” he said, “we shall find a way. Have no fear of that, O Kalubi. We  are not afraid of the big ape whom you call a god. Yet it must be at a  price. We will not kill this beast and try to save your life, save at a  price.”    “What price?” asked the Kalubi nervously. “There are wives and  cattle--no, you do not want the wives, and the cattle cannot be taken  across the lake. There are gold dust and ivory. I have already promised  these, and there is nothing more that I can give.”    “The price is, O Kalubi, that you hand over to us to be taken away  the white woman who is called Mother of the Holy Flower, with her  daughter----”    “And,” interrupted Stephen, to whom I had been interpreting, “the Holy  Flower itself, all of it dug up by the roots.”    When he heard these modest requests the poor Kalubi became like one upon  the verge of madness.    “Do you understand,” he gasped, “do you understand that you are asking  for the gods of my country?”    “Quite,” replied Brother John with calmness; “for the gods of your  country--nothing more nor less.”    The Kalubi made as though he would fly from the hut, but I caught him by  the arm and said:    “See, friend, things are thus. You ask us, at great danger to ourselves,  
“You have returned, as I knew you would, and now we shall learn whether  White Beard yonder spoke true words when he said that his god would be  avenged upon our god. You shall go to be avenged on him if you can,  and then we shall learn. But this time you have none of your iron tubes  which alone we fear. For did not the god declare to us through me that  when the white men came back with an iron tube, then he, the god, would  die, and I, the Motombo, the god’s Mouth, would die, and the Holy Flower  would be torn up, and the Mother of the Flower would pass away, and the  people of the Pongo would be dispersed and become wanderers and slaves?  And did he not declare that if the white men came again without their  iron tubes, then certain secret things would happen--oh! ask them not,  in time they shall be known to you, and the people of the Pongo who were  dwindling would again become fruitful and very great? And that is why we  welcome you, white men, who arise again from the land of ghosts, because  through you we, the Pongo, shall become fruitful and very great.”    Of a sudden he ceased his rumbling talk, his head sank back between his  shoulders and he sat silent for a long while, his fierce, sparkling  eyes playing on us as though he would read our very thoughts. If he  succeeded, I hope that mine pleased him. To tell the truth, I was filled  with mixed fear, fury and loathing. Although, of course, I did not  believe a word of all the rubbish he had been saying, which was akin to  much that is evolved by these black-hearted African wizards, I hated the  creature whom I felt to be only half-human. My whole nature sickened at  his aspect and talk. And yet I was dreadfully afraid of him. I felt as  a man might who wakes up to find himself alone with some peculiarly  disgusting Christmas-story kind of ghost. Moreover I was quite sure that  he meant us ill, fearful and imminent ill. Suddenly he spoke again:    “Who is that little yellow one,” he said, “that old one with a face like 
 wanted me to try a shot, but I would not, knowing that the chances of  hitting it were small indeed. With only three charges, or rather three  caps left, it was necessary to be saving.    We halted and held a consultation, as a result of which we decided  that there was no more danger in going on than in standing still or  attempting to return. So we went on, keeping close together. To me, as  I was the only one with a rifle, was accorded what I did not at all  appreciate, the honour of heading the procession.    Another half-mile and again we heard that strange rolling sound which  was produced, I believe, by the great brute beating upon its breast, but  noted that it was not so continuous as on the previous night.    “Ha!” said Hans, “he can only strike his drum with one stick now. Your  bullet broke the other, Baas.”    A little farther and the god roared quite close, so loudly that the air  seemed to tremble.    “The drum is all right, whatever may have happened to the sticks,” I  said.    A hundred yards or so more and the catastrophe occurred. We had reached  a spot in the forest where one of the great trees had fallen down,  letting in a little light. I can see it to this hour. There lay the  enormous tree, its bark covered with grey mosses and clumps of a giant  species of maidenhair fern. On our side of it was the open space  which may have measured forty feet across, where the light fell in a  perpendicular ray, as it does through the smoke-hole of a hut. Looking  at this prostrate trunk, I saw first two lurid and fiery eyes that  glowed red in the shadow; and then, almost in the same instant, made  out what looked like the head of a fiend enclosed in a wreath of the  delicate green ferns. I can’t describe it, I can only repeat that it  looked like the head of a very large fiend with a pallid face, huge  overhanging eyebrows and great yellow tushes on either side of the  mouth. 
more such orchids growing in the country?    “No,” she replied, “or at least I never heard of any. Indeed, I have  always been told that this one was brought from far away generations  ago. Also, under an ancient law, it is never allowed to increase. Any  shoots it sends up beyond this ring must be cut off by me and destroyed  with certain ceremonies. You see that seed-pod which has been left to  grow on the stalk of one of last year’s blooms. It is now ripe, and on  the night of the next new moon, when the Kalubi comes to visit me,  I must with much ritual burn it in his presence, unless it has burst  before he arrives, in which case I must burn any seedlings that may  spring up with almost the same ritual.”    “I don’t think the Kalubi will come any more; at least, not while you  are here. Indeed, I am sure of it,” I said.    As we were leaving the place, acting on my general principle of making  sure of anything of value when I get the chance, I broke off that ripe  seed-pod, which was of the size of an orange. No one was looking at the  time, and as it went straight into my pocket, no one missed it.    Then, leaving Stephen and the young lady to admire this Cypripedium--or  each other--in the enclosure, we three elders returned to the house to  discuss matters.    “John and Mrs. Eversley,” I said, “by Heaven’s mercy you are reunited  after a terrible separation of over twenty years. But what is to be  done now? The god, it is true, is dead, and therefore the passage of the  forest will be easy. But beyond it is the water which we have no means  of crossing and beyond the water that old wizard, the Motombo, sits in  the mouth of his cave watching like a spider in its web. And beyond  the Motombo and his cave are Komba, the new Kalubi and his tribe of  cannibals----”    “Cannibals!” interrupted Mrs. Eversley, “I never knew that they were  cannibals. Indeed, I know little about the Pongo, whom I scarcely ever 
 all cost, for if once it went beneath it would be useless. Also I was  desperately afraid of being seen in the lightning flashes, although to  minimise this risk I had kept my dark-coloured cloth hat upon my head.  Lastly there was the lightning itself to fear, for it was fearful and  continuous and seemed to be striking along the water. It was a fact that  a fire-ball or something of the sort hit the surface within a few yards  of me, as though it had aimed at the rifle-barrel and just missed. Or so  I thought, though it may have been a crocodile rising at the moment.    In one way, or rather, in two, however, I was lucky. The first was the  complete absence of wind which must have raised waves that might have  swamped me and would at any rate have wetted the rifle. The second was  that there was no fear of my losing my path for in the mouth of the cave  I could see the glow of the fires which burned on either side of the  Motombo’s seat. They served the same purpose to me as did the lamp of  the lady called Hero to her lover Leander when he swam the Hellespont  to pay her clandestine visits at night. But he had something pleasant to  look forward to, whereas I----! Still, there was another point in common  between us. Hero, if I remember right, was a priestess of the Greek  goddess of love, whereas the party who waited me was also in a religious  line of business. Only, as I firmly believe, he was a priest of the  devil.    I suppose that swim took me about a quarter-of-an-hour, for I went  slowly to save my strength, although the crocodiles suggested haste. But  thank Heaven they never appeared to complicate matters. Now I was quite  near the cave, and now I was beneath the overhanging roof and in the  shallow water of the little bay that formed a harbour for the canoe. I  stood upon my feet on the rock bottom, the water coming up to my breast,  and peered about me, while I rested and worked my left arm, stiff with  
got back safe, except for the Mazitu, Jerry, who doesn’t matter,  for there are plenty more like him, and the wound in Baas Stephen’s  shoulder, and that heavy flower which he thought better than brandy.”    “Yes, Hans,” I said, “I did well to take you and you are clever, for had  it not been for you, we should now be cooked and eaten in Pongo-land. I  thank you for your help, old friend. But, Hans, another time please sew  up the holes in your waistcoat pocket. Four caps wasn’t much, Hans.”    “No, Baas, but it was enough; as they were all good ones. If there had  been forty you could not have done much more. Oh! your reverend father  knew all that” (my departed parent had become a kind of patron saint to  Hans) “and did not wish this poor old Hottentot to have more to carry  than was needed. He knew you wouldn’t miss, Baas, and that there were  only one god, one devil, and one man waiting to be killed.”    I laughed, for Hans’s way of putting things was certainly original, and  having got on my coat, went to see Stephen. At the door of the tent I  met Brother John, whose shoulder was dreadfully sore from the rubbing of  the orchid stretcher, as were his hands with paddling, but who otherwise  was well enough and of course supremely happy.    He told me that he had cleansed and sewn up Stephen’s wound, which  appeared to be doing well, although the spear had pierced right through  the shoulder, luckily without cutting any artery. So I went in to see  the patient and found him cheerful enough, though weak from weariness  and loss of blood, with Miss Hope feeding him with broth from a wooden  native spoon. I didn’t stop very long, especially after he got on to  the subject of the lost orchid, about which he began to show signs of  excitement. This I allayed as well as I could by telling him that I had  preserved a pod of the seed, news at which he was delighted.    “There!” he said. “To think that you, Allan, should have remembered to  take that precaution when I, an orchidist, forgot all about it!” 
 taught her how to use a rifle.    I called to him to send her away, but again she would not go, even after  a bullet had pierced her dress.    Still, all our shooting could not stop that rush of men, made desperate  by the fear of a fiery death. Leaving many stretched out behind them,  the first of the Arabs drew near to the south gate.    “My father,” said Mavovo in my ear, “now the real fighting is going to  begin. The gate will soon be down. _We_ must be the gate.”    I nodded, for if the Arabs once got through, there were enough of them  left to wipe us out five times over. Indeed, I do not suppose that up  to this time they had actually lost more than forty men. A few words  explained the situation to Stephen and Brother John, whom I told to  take his daughter to her mother and wait there with them. The Mazitu I  ordered to throw down their guns, for if they kept these I was sure they  would shoot some of us, and to accompany us, bringing their spears only.    Then we rushed down the slope and took up our position in a little open  space in front of the gate, that now was tottering to its fall beneath  the blows and draggings of the Arabs. At this time the sight was  terrible and magnificent, for the flames had got hold of the two  half-circles of huts that embraced the market-place, and, fanned by  the blast, were rushing towards us like a thing alive. Above us swept  a great pall of smoke in which floated flakes of fire, so thick that it  hid the sky, though fortunately the wind did not suffer it to sink  and choke us. The sounds also were almost inconceivable, for to the  crackling roar of the conflagration as it devoured hut after hut, were  added the coarse, yelling voices of the half-bred Arabs, as in mingled  rage and terror they tore at the gateway or each other, and the reports  of the guns which many of them were still firing, half at hazard.    We formed up before the gate, the Zulus with Stephen and myself in front
