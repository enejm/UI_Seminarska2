16  In the Darkness of the Night  17  On the Deck of the "Kincaid"  18  Paulvitch Plots Revenge  19  The Last of the "Kincaid"  20  Jungle Island Again  21  The Law of the Jungle          Chapter 1    Kidnapped      "The entire affair is shrouded in mystery," said D'Arnot.  "I have it  on the best of authority that neither the police nor the special agents  of the general staff have the faintest conception of how it was  accomplished.  All they know, all that anyone knows, is that Nikolas  Rokoff has escaped."    John Clayton, Lord Greystoke--he who had been "Tarzan of the Apes"--sat  in silence in the apartments of his friend, Lieutenant Paul D'Arnot, in  Paris, gazing meditatively at the toe of his immaculate boot.    His mind revolved many memories, recalled by the escape of his  arch-enemy from the French military prison to which he had been  sentenced for life upon the testimony of the ape-man.    He thought of the lengths to which Rokoff had once gone to compass his  death, and he realized that what the man had already done would  doubtless be as nothing by comparison with what he would wish and plot  to do now that he was again free.    Tarzan had recently brought his wife and infant son to London to escape  the discomforts and dangers of the rainy season upon their vast estate  in Uziri--the land of the savage Waziri warriors whose broad African  domains the ape-man had once ruled.    He had run across the Channel for a brief visit with his old friend,  but the news of the Russian's escape had already cast a shadow upon his  outing, so that though he had but just arrived he was already  contemplating an immediate return to London.    "It is not that I fear for myself, Paul," he said at last.   "Many  times in the past have I thwarted Rokoff's designs upon my life; but  now there are others to consider.  Unless I misjudge the man, he would 
toward the wharf and along it until across the water they saw a small  boat just pulling into the shadows of a near-by steamer.    "There they be," whispered the man.    "Ten pounds if you will find a boat and row me to that steamer," cried  the woman.    "Quick, then," he replied, "for we gotta go it if we're goin' to catch  the Kincaid afore she sails.  She's had steam up for three hours an'  jest been a-waitin' fer that one passenger.   I was a-talkin' to one of  her crew 'arf an hour ago."    As he spoke he led the way to the end of the wharf where he knew  another boat lay moored, and, lowering the woman into it, he jumped in  after and pushed off.  The two were soon scudding over the water.    At the steamer's side the man demanded his pay and, without waiting to  count out the exact amount, the woman thrust a handful of bank-notes  into his outstretched hand.  A single glance at them convinced the  fellow that he had been more than well paid.  Then he assisted her up  the ladder, holding his skiff close to the ship's side against the  chance that this profitable passenger might wish to be taken ashore  later.    But presently the sound of the donkey engine and the rattle of a steel  cable on the hoisting-drum proclaimed the fact that the Kincaid's  anchor was being raised, and a moment later the waiter heard the  propellers revolving, and slowly the little steamer moved away from him  out into the channel.    As he turned to row back to shore he heard a woman's shriek from the  ship's deck.    "That's wot I calls rotten luck," he soliloquized.  "I might jest as  well of 'ad the whole bloomin' wad."      When Jane Clayton climbed to the deck of the Kincaid she found the ship  apparently deserted.  There was no sign of those she sought nor of any  other aboard, and so she went about her search for her husband and the  child she hoped against hope to find there without interruption. 
yourself against    N. R.    "P.S.--The balance of your punishment has to do with what shall  presently befall your wife--that I shall leave to your imagination."      As he finished reading, a slight sound behind him brought him back with  a start to the world of present realities.    Instantly his senses awoke, and he was again Tarzan of the Apes.    As he wheeled about, it was a beast at bay, vibrant with the instinct  of self-preservation, that faced a huge bull-ape that was already  charging down upon him.    The two years that had elapsed since Tarzan had come out of the savage  forest with his rescued mate had witnessed slight diminution of the  mighty powers that had made him the invincible lord of the jungle.  His  great estates in Uziri had claimed much of his time and attention, and  there he had found ample field for the practical use and retention of  his almost superhuman powers; but naked and unarmed to do battle with  the shaggy, bull-necked beast that now confronted him was a test that  the ape-man would scarce have welcomed at any period of his wild  existence.    But there was no alternative other than to meet the rage-maddened  creature with the weapons with which nature had endowed him.    Over the bull's shoulder Tarzan could see now the heads and shoulders  of perhaps a dozen more of these mighty fore-runners of primitive man.    He knew, however, that there was little chance that they would attack  him, since it is not within the reasoning powers of the anthropoid to  be able to weigh or appreciate the value of concentrated action against  an enemy--otherwise they would long since have become the dominant  creatures of their haunts, so tremendous a power of destruction lies in  their mighty thews and savage fangs.    With a low snarl the beast now hurled himself at Tarzan, but the  ape-man had found, among other things in the haunts of civilized man,  certain methods of scientific warfare that are unknown to the jungle  folk.    Whereas, a few years since, he would have met the brute rush with brute 
talons.    There was a thud below him as the baffled cat fell back to earth, and  then Tarzan of the Apes, drawing his dinner farther up to the safety of  a higher limb, looked down with grinning face into the gleaming yellow  eyes of the other wild beast that glared up at him from beneath, and  with taunting insults flaunted the tender carcass of his kill in the  face of him whom he had cheated of it.    With his crude stone knife he cut a juicy steak from the hindquarters,  and while the great lion paced, growling, back and forth below him,  Lord Greystoke filled his savage belly, nor ever in the choicest of his  exclusive London clubs had a meal tasted more palatable.    The warm blood of his kill smeared his hands and face and filled his  nostrils with the scent that the savage carnivora love best.    And when he had finished he left the balance of the carcass in a high  fork of the tree where he had dined, and with Numa trailing below him,  still keen for revenge, he made his way back to his tree-top shelter,  where he slept until the sun was high the following morning.          Chapter 4    Sheeta      The next few days were occupied by Tarzan in completing his weapons and  exploring the jungle.  He strung his bow with tendons from the buck  upon which he had dined his first evening upon the new shore, and  though he would have preferred the gut of Sheeta for the purpose, he  was content to wait until opportunity permitted him to kill one of the  great cats.    He also braided a long grass rope--such a rope as he had used so many  years before to tantalize the ill-natured Tublat, and which later had  developed into a wondrous effective weapon in the practised hands of  the little ape-boy.    A sheath and handle for his hunting-knife he fashioned, and a quiver  for arrows, and from the hide of Bara a belt and loin-cloth.  Then he  set out to learn something of the strange land in which he found 
With an angry, warning roar he sprang forward to chase them from their  kill.  Sheeta bounded into a near-by thicket, while Tarzan took to the  low branches of an overhanging tree.    Here the ape-man unloosed his grass rope from about his neck, and as  Numa stood above the body of the boar, challenging head erect, he  dropped the sinuous noose about the maned neck, drawing the stout  strands taut with a sudden jerk.   At the same time he called shrilly  to Sheeta, as he drew the struggling lion upward until only his hind  feet touched the ground.    Quickly he made the rope fast to a stout branch, and as the panther, in  answer to his summons, leaped into sight, Tarzan dropped to the earth  beside the struggling and infuriated Numa, and with a long sharp knife  sprang upon him at one side even as Sheeta did upon the other.    The panther tore and rent Numa upon the right, while the ape-man struck  home with his stone knife upon the other, so that before the mighty  clawing of the king of beasts had succeeded in parting the rope he hung  quite dead and harmless in the noose.    And then upon the jungle air there rose in unison from two savage  throats the victory cry of the bull-ape and the panther, blended into  one frightful and uncanny scream.    As the last notes died away in a long-drawn, fearsome wail, a score of  painted warriors, drawing their long war-canoe upon the beach, halted  to stare in the direction of the jungle and to listen.          Chapter 5    Mugambi      By the time that Tarzan had travelled entirely about the coast of the  island, and made several trips inland from various points, he was sure  that he was the only human being upon it.    Nowhere had he found any sign that men had stopped even temporarily  upon this shore, though, of course, he knew that so quickly does the  rank vegetation of the tropics erase all but the most permanent of  human monuments that he might be in error in his deductions. 
  And so it was that when the first fair wind rose he embarked upon his  cruise, and with him he took as strange and fearsome a crew as ever  sailed under a savage master.    Mugambi and Akut went with him, and Sheeta, the panther, and a dozen  great males of the tribe of Akut.          Chapter 6    A Hideous Crew      The war-canoe with its savage load moved slowly toward the break in the  reef through which it must pass to gain the open sea.  Tarzan, Mugambi,  and Akut wielded the paddles, for the shore kept the west wind from the  little sail.    Sheeta crouched in the bow at the ape-man's feet, for it had seemed  best to Tarzan always to keep the wicked beast as far from the other  members of the party as possible, since it would require little or no  provocation to send him at the throat of any than the white man, whom  he evidently now looked upon as his master.    In the stern was Mugambi, and just in front of him squatted Akut, while  between Akut and Tarzan the twelve hairy apes sat upon their haunches,  blinking dubiously this way and that, and now and then turning their  eyes longingly back toward shore.    All went well until the canoe had passed beyond the reef.   Here the  breeze struck the sail, sending the rude craft lunging among the waves  that ran higher and higher as they drew away from the shore.    With the tossing of the boat the apes became panic-stricken.  They  first moved uneasily about, and then commenced grumbling and whining.  With difficulty Akut kept them in hand for a time; but when a  particularly large wave struck the dugout simultaneously with a little  squall of wind their terror broke all bounds, and, leaping to their  feet, they all but overturned the boat before Akut and Tarzan together  could quiet them.  At last calm was restored, and eventually the apes  became accustomed to the strange antics of their craft, after which no  more trouble was experienced with them. 
"What is it?" he whispered.    "It is Bwana Tarzan and his people," replied Mugambi.   "But what they  are doing I know not, unless it be that they are devouring your people  who ran away."    Kaviri shuddered and rolled his eyes fearfully toward the jungle.  In  all his long life in the savage forest he had never heard such an  awful, fearsome din.    Closer and closer came the sounds, and now with them were mingled the  terrified shrieks of women and children and of men.  For twenty long  minutes the blood-curdling cries continued, until they seemed but a  stone's throw from the palisade.  Kaviri rose to flee, but Mugambi  seized and held him, for such had been the command of Tarzan.    A moment later a horde of terrified natives burst from the jungle,  racing toward the shelter of their huts.  Like frightened sheep they  ran, and behind them, driving them as sheep might be driven, came  Tarzan and Sheeta and the hideous apes of Akut.    Presently Tarzan stood before Kaviri, the old quiet smile upon his lips.    "Your people have returned, my brother," he said, "and now you may  select those who are to accompany me and paddle my canoe."    Tremblingly Kaviri tottered to his feet, calling to his people to come  from their huts; but none responded to his summons.    "Tell them," suggested Tarzan, "that if they do not come I shall send  my people in after them."    Kaviri did as he was bid, and in an instant the entire population of  the village came forth, their wide and frightened eyes rolling from one  to another of the savage creatures that wandered about the village  street.    Quickly Kaviri designated a dozen warriors to accompany Tarzan.  The  poor fellows went almost white with terror at the prospect of close  contact with the panther and the apes in the narrow confines of the  canoes; but when Kaviri explained to them that there was no  escape--that Bwana Tarzan would pursue them with his grim horde should  they attempt to run away from the duty--they finally went gloomily down 
All that night the creature pursued its lonely way, and the next day it  halted only to make a single kill, which it tore to fragments and  devoured with sullen, grumbling rumbles as though half famished for  lack of food.    It was dusk when it approached the palisade that surrounded a large  native village.  Like the shadow of a swift and silent death it circled  the village, nose to ground, halting at last close to the palisade,  where it almost touched the backs of several huts.  Here the beast  sniffed for a moment, and then, turning its head upon one side,  listened with up-pricked ears.    What it heard was no sound by the standards of human ears, yet to the  highly attuned and delicate organs of the beast a message seemed to be  borne to the savage brain.  A wondrous transformation was wrought in  the motionless mass of statuesque bone and muscle that had an instant  before stood as though carved out of the living bronze.    As if it had been poised upon steel springs, suddenly released, it rose  quickly and silently to the top of the palisade, disappearing,  stealthily and cat-like, into the dark space between the wall and the  back of an adjacent hut.    In the village street beyond women were preparing many little fires and  fetching cooking-pots filled with water, for a great feast was to be  celebrated ere the night was many hours older.   About a stout stake  near the centre of the circling fires a little knot of black warriors  stood conversing, their bodies smeared with white and blue and ochre in  broad and grotesque bands.   Great circles of colour were drawn about  their eyes and lips, their breasts and abdomens, and from their  clay-plastered coiffures rose gay feathers and bits of long, straight  wire.    The village was preparing for the feast, while in a hut at one side of  the scene of the coming orgy the bound victim of their bestial  appetites lay waiting for the end.  And such an end!    Tarzan of the Apes, tensing his mighty muscles, strained at the bonds 
I may.    "Your husband was a brute--you know that best who found him naked in  his native jungle, roaming wild with the savage beasts that were his  fellows.  Now I am a gentleman, not only born of noble blood, but  raised gently as befits a man of quality.    "To you, dear Jane, I offer the love of a cultured man and association  with one of culture and refinement, which you must have sorely missed  in your relations with the poor ape that through your girlish  infatuation you married so thoughtlessly.   I love you, Jane.  You have  but to say the word and no further sorrows shall afflict you--even your  baby shall be returned to you unharmed."    Outside the door Sven Anderssen paused with the noonday meal he had  been carrying to Lady Greystoke.  Upon the end of his long, stringy  neck his little head was cocked to one side, his close-set eyes were  half closed, his ears, so expressive was his whole attitude of stealthy  eavesdropping, seemed truly to be cocked forward--even his long,  yellow, straggly moustache appeared to assume a sly droop.    As Rokoff closed his appeal, awaiting the reply he invited, the look of  surprise upon Jane Clayton's face turned to one of disgust.  She fairly  shuddered in the fellow's face.    "I would not have been surprised, M.  Rokoff," she said, "had you  attempted to force me to submit to your evil desires, but that you  should be so fatuous as to believe that I, wife of John Clayton, would  come to you willingly, even to save my life, I should never have  imagined.  I have known you for a scoundrel, M.  Rokoff; but until now  I had not taken you for a fool."    Rokoff's eyes narrowed, and the red of mortification flushed out the  pallor of his face.  He took a step toward the girl, threateningly.    "We shall see who is the fool at last," he hissed, "when I have broken  you to my will and your plebeian Yankee stubbornness has cost you all  that you hold dear--even the life of your baby--for, by the bones of 
As for Sheeta--the great cat understood even less than the apes; but  yet Tarzan could not but marvel at the remarkable characteristics this  beast had evidenced.  That it felt real affection for him there seemed  little doubt, for now that the blacks were disposed of it walked slowly  back and forth about the stake, rubbing its sides against the ape-man's  legs and purring like a contented tabby.  That it had gone of its own  volition to bring the balance of the pack to his rescue, Tarzan could  not doubt.  His Sheeta was indeed a jewel among beasts.    Mugambi's absence worried the ape-man not a little.   He attempted to  learn from Akut what had become of the black, fearing that the beasts,  freed from the restraint of Tarzan's presence, might have fallen upon  the man and devoured him; but to all his questions the great ape but  pointed back in the direction from which they had come out of the  jungle.    The night passed with Tarzan still fast bound to the stake, and shortly  after dawn his fears were realized in the discovery of naked black  figures moving stealthily just within the edge of the jungle about the  village.  The blacks were returning.    With daylight their courage would be equal to the demands of a charge  upon the handful of beasts that had routed them from their rightful  abodes.  The result of the encounter seemed foregone if the savages  could curb their superstitious terror, for against their overwhelming  numbers, their long spears and poisoned arrows, the panther and the  apes could not be expected to survive a really determined attack.    That the blacks were preparing for a charge became apparent a few  moments later, when they commenced to show themselves in force upon the  edge of the clearing, dancing and jumping about as they waved their  spears and shouted taunts and fierce warcries toward the village.    These manoeuvres Tarzan knew would continue until the blacks had worked  themselves into a state of hysterical courage sufficient to sustain  them for a short charge toward the village, and even though he doubted  that they would reach it at the first attempt, he believed that at the 
dangerous a journey or not was a question.    Fear might drive him to the attempt now that he knew the manner of  horrible pack that was upon his trail, and that Tarzan of the Apes was  following him to wreak upon him the vengeance that he deserved.    At last the ape-man determined to continue toward the northeast in the  general direction of German East Africa until he came upon natives from  whom he might gain information as to Rokoff's whereabouts.    The second day following the cessation of the rain Tarzan came upon a  native village the inhabitants of which fled into the bush the instant  their eyes fell upon him.  Tarzan, not to be thwarted in any such  manner as this, pursued them, and after a brief chase caught up with a  young warrior.  The fellow was so badly frightened that he was unable  to defend himself, dropping his weapons and falling upon the ground,  wide-eyed and screaming as he gazed on his captor.    It was with considerable difficulty that the ape-man quieted the  fellow's fears sufficiently to obtain a coherent statement from him as  to the cause of his uncalled-for terror.    From him Tarzan learned, by dint of much coaxing, that a party of  whites had passed through the village several days before.  These men  had told them of a terrible white devil that pursued them, warning the  natives against it and the frightful pack of demons that accompanied it.    The black had recognized Tarzan as the white devil from the  descriptions given by the whites and their black servants.   Behind him  he had expected to see a horde of demons disguised as apes and panthers.    In this Tarzan saw the cunning hand of Rokoff.  The Russian was  attempting to make travel as difficult as possible for him by turning  the natives against him in superstitious fear.    The native further told Tarzan that the white man who had led the  recent expedition had promised them a fabulous reward if they would  kill the white devil.  This they had fully intended doing should the  opportunity present itself; but the moment they had seen Tarzan their 
Anderssen took to the river, purchasing a canoe from a chief whose  village lay a short distance from the Ugambi upon the bank of a  tributary.    Thereafter the little party of fugitives fled up the broad Ugambi, and  so rapid had their flight become that they no longer received word of  their pursuers.  At the end of canoe navigation upon the river, they  abandoned their canoe and took to the jungle.  Here progress became at  once arduous, slow, and dangerous.    The second day after leaving the Ugambi the baby fell ill with fever.  Anderssen knew what the outcome must be, but he had not the heart to  tell Jane Clayton the truth, for he had seen that the young woman had  come to love the child almost as passionately as though it had been her  own flesh and blood.    As the baby's condition precluded farther advance, Anderssen withdrew a  little from the main trail he had been following and built a camp in a  natural clearing on the bank of a little river.    Here Jane devoted her every moment to caring for the tiny sufferer, and  as though her sorrow and anxiety were not all that she could bear, a  further blow came with the sudden announcement of one of the Mosula  porters who had been foraging in the jungle adjacent that Rokoff and  his party were camped quite close to them, and were evidently upon  their trail to this little nook which all had thought so excellent a  hiding-place.    This information could mean but one thing, and that they must break  camp and fly onward regardless of the baby's condition.   Jane Clayton  knew the traits of the Russian well enough to be positive that he would  separate her from the child the moment that he recaptured them, and she  knew that separation would mean the immediate death of the baby.    As they stumbled forward through the tangled vegetation along an old  and almost overgrown game trail the Mosula porters deserted them one by  one.    The men had been staunch enough in their devotion and loyalty as long  as they were in no danger of being overtaken by the Russian and his 
have had the love of a gentleman--of Nikolas Rokoff," he replied.  "But  where is the use in discussing the matter?  We shall bury the child  here, and you will return with me at once to my own camp.  Tomorrow I  shall bring you back and turn you over to your new husband--the lovely  M'ganwazam.  Come!"    He reached out for the child.  Jane, who was on her feet now, turned  away from him.    "I shall bury the body," she said.  "Send some men to dig a grave  outside the village."    Rokoff was anxious to have the thing over and get back to his camp with  his victim.  He thought he saw in her apathy a resignation to her fate.  Stepping outside the hut, he motioned her to follow him, and a moment  later, with his men, he escorted Jane beyond the village, where beneath  a great tree the blacks scooped a shallow grave.    Wrapping the tiny body in a blanket, Jane laid it tenderly in the black  hole, and, turning her head that she might not see the mouldy earth  falling upon the pitiful little bundle, she breathed a prayer beside  the grave of the nameless waif that had won its way to the innermost  recesses of her heart.    Then, dry-eyed but suffering, she rose and followed the Russian through  the Stygian blackness of the jungle, along the winding, leafy corridor  that led from the village of M'ganwazam, the black cannibal, to the  camp of Nikolas Rokoff, the white fiend.    Beside them, in the impenetrable thickets that fringed the path, rising  to arch above it and shut out the moon, the girl could hear the  stealthy, muffled footfalls of great beasts, and ever round about them  rose the deafening roars of hunting lions, until the earth trembled to  the mighty sound.    The porters lighted torches now and waved them upon either hand to  frighten off the beasts of prey.  Rokoff urged them to greater speed,  and from the quavering note in his voice Jane Clayton knew that he was  weak from terror.    The sounds of the jungle night recalled most vividly the days and 
down in their midst, fell assiduously to the business of preening,  which occupies most of the waking hours of the cat family.    If the young woman was surprised by the sight of these natural enemies  fraternizing, it was with emotions little short of fear for her own  sanity that she presently saw a tall, muscular warrior enter the  clearing and join the group of savage beasts assembled there.    At first sight of the man she had been positive that he would be torn  to pieces, and she had half risen from her shelter, raising her rifle  to her shoulder to do what she could to avert the man's terrible fate.    Now she saw that he seemed actually conversing with the beasts--issuing  orders to them.    Presently the entire company filed on across the clearing and  disappeared in the jungle upon the opposite side.    With a gasp of mingled incredulity and relief Jane Clayton staggered to  her feet and fled on away from the terrible horde that had just passed  her, while a half-mile behind her another individual, following the  same trail as she, lay frozen with terror behind an ant-hill as the  hideous band passed quite close to him.    This one was Rokoff; but he had recognized the members of the awful  aggregation as allies of Tarzan of the Apes.   No sooner, therefore,  had the beasts passed him than he rose and raced through the jungle as  fast as he could go, in order that he might put as much distance as  possible between himself and these frightful beasts.    So it happened that as Jane Clayton came to the bank of the river, down  which she hoped to float to the ocean and eventual rescue, Nikolas  Rokoff was but a short distance in her rear.    Upon the bank the girl saw a great dugout drawn half-way from the water  and tied securely to a near-by tree.    This, she felt, would solve the question of transportation to the sea  could she but launch the huge, unwieldy craft.   Unfastening the rope  that had moored it to the tree, Jane pushed frantically upon the bow of 
have forced the heavy dugout up-stream against it, and all that was  left her was to attempt either to make the shore without being seen by  those upon the deck of the Kincaid, or to throw herself upon their  mercy--otherwise she must be swept out to sea.    She knew that the shore held little hope of life for her, as she had no  knowledge of the location of the friendly Mosula village to which  Anderssen had taken her through the darkness of the night of their  escape from the Kincaid.    With Rokoff away from the steamer it might be possible that by offering  those in charge a large reward they could be induced to carry her to  the nearest civilized port.  It was worth risking--if she could make  the steamer at all.    The current was bearing her swiftly down the river, and she found that  only by dint of the utmost exertion could she direct the awkward craft  toward the vicinity of the Kincaid.   Having reached the decision to  board the steamer, she now looked to it for aid, but to her surprise  the decks appeared to be empty and she saw no sign of life aboard the  ship.    The dugout was drawing closer and closer to the bow of the vessel, and  yet no hail came over the side from any lookout aboard.  In a moment  more, Jane realized, she would be swept beyond the steamer, and then,  unless they lowered a boat to rescue her, she would be carried far out  to sea by the current and the swift ebb tide that was running.    The young woman called loudly for assistance, but there was no reply  other than the shrill scream of some savage beast upon the  jungle-shrouded shore.  Frantically Jane wielded the paddle in an  effort to carry her craft close alongside the steamer.    For a moment it seemed that she should miss her goal by but a few feet,  but at the last moment the canoe swung close beneath the steamer's bow  and Jane barely managed to grasp the anchor chain.    Heroically she clung to the heavy iron links, almost dragged from the 
the Benguela current which flows northward along the coast of Africa,  and, as a south wind was prevailing, Jane hoped to be out of sight of  the mouth of the Ugambi before Rokoff could become aware of the  departure of the steamer.    Standing over the labouring seamen, the young woman breathed a sigh of  relief as the last strand of the cable parted and she knew that the  vessel was on its way out of the maw of the savage Ugambi.    With her two prisoners still beneath the coercing influence of her  rifle, she ordered them upon deck with the intention of again  imprisoning them in the forecastle; but at length she permitted herself  to be influenced by their promises of loyalty and the arguments which  they put forth that they could be of service to her, and permitted them  to remain above.    For a few minutes the Kincaid drifted rapidly with the current, and  then, with a grinding jar, she stopped in midstream.   The ship had run  upon a low-lying bar that splits the channel about a quarter of a mile  from the sea.    For a moment she hung there, and then, swinging round until her bow  pointed toward the shore, she broke adrift once more.    At the same instant, just as Jane Clayton was congratulating herself  that the ship was once more free, there fell upon her ears from a point  up the river about where the Kincaid had been anchored the rattle of  musketry and a woman's scream--shrill, piercing, fear-laden.    The sailors heard the shots with certain conviction that they announced  the coming of their employer, and as they had no relish for the plan  that would consign them to the deck of a drifting derelict, they  whispered together a hurried plan to overcome the young woman and hail  Rokoff and their companions to their rescue.    It seemed that fate would play into their hands, for with the reports  of the guns Jane Clayton's attention had been distracted from her  unwilling assistants, and instead of keeping one eye upon them as she  had intended doing, she ran to the bow of the Kincaid to peer through 
case, but he had assured Jane time and time again that the little one  he had brought to her cabin the night he aided her to escape was the  only one that had been aboard the Kincaid since she lay at Dover.          Chapter 18    Paulvitch Plots Revenge      As Jane and Tarzan stood upon the vessel's deck recounting to one  another the details of the various adventures through which each had  passed since they had parted in their London home, there glared at them  from beneath scowling brows a hidden watcher upon the shore.    Through the man's brain passed plan after plan whereby he might thwart  the escape of the Englishman and his wife, for so long as the vital  spark remained within the vindictive brain of Alexander Paulvitch none  who had aroused the enmity of the Russian might be entirely safe.    Plan after plan he formed only to discard each either as impracticable,  or unworthy the vengeance his wrongs demanded.   So warped by faulty  reasoning was the criminal mind of Rokoff's lieutenant that he could  not grasp the real truth of that which lay between himself and the  ape-man and see that always the fault had been, not with the English  lord, but with himself and his confederate.    And at the rejection of each new scheme Paulvitch arrived always at the  same conclusion--that he could accomplish naught while half the breadth  of the Ugambi separated him from the object of his hatred.    But how was he to span the crocodile-infested waters?  There was no  canoe nearer than the Mosula village, and Paulvitch was none too sure  that the Kincaid would still be at anchor in the river when he returned  should he take the time to traverse the jungle to the distant village  and return with a canoe.  Yet there was no other way, and so, convinced  that thus alone might he hope to reach his prey, Paulvitch, with a  parting scowl at the two figures upon the Kincaid's deck, turned away  from the river.    Hastening through the dense jungle, his mind centred upon his one 
"Is anyone sleeping in my cabin?" he asked.    The sailor shook his head.  "No," he said; "Lord and Lady Greystoke  have the captain's cabin.  The mate is in his own, and there ain't no  one in yours."    "I'll go and get my valuables for you," said Paulvitch.    "I'll go with you to see that you don't try any funny business," said  the sailor, and he followed the Russian up the ladder to the deck.    At the cabin entrance the sailor halted to watch, permitting Paulvitch  to go alone to his cabin.  Here he gathered together his few belongings  that were to buy him the uncertain safety of escape, and as he stood  for a moment beside the little table on which he had piled them he  searched his brain for some feasible plan either to ensure his safety  or to bring revenge upon his enemies.    And presently as he thought there recurred to his memory the little  black box which lay hidden in a secret receptacle beneath a false top  upon the table where his hand rested.    The Russian's face lighted to a sinister gleam of malevolent  satisfaction as he stooped and felt beneath the table top.   A moment  later he withdrew from its hiding-place the thing he sought.  He had  lighted the lantern swinging from the beams overhead that he might see  to collect his belongings, and now he held the black box well in the  rays of the lamplight, while he fingered at the clasp that fastened its  lid.    The lifted cover revealed two compartments within the box.   In one was  a mechanism which resembled the works of a small clock.  There also was  a little battery of two dry cells.  A wire ran from the clockwork to  one of the poles of the battery, and from the other pole through the  partition into the other compartment, a second wire returning directly  to the clockwork.    Whatever lay within the second compartment was not visible, for a cover  lay over it and appeared to be sealed in place by asphaltum.  In the 
the others could not leave Jungle Island without him; but what was  there to prevent Gust, with just sufficient men to man the schooner,  slipping away from Kai Shang, Momulla the Maori, and some half of the  crew when opportunity presented?    It was for this opportunity that Gust waited.  Some day there would  come a moment when Kai Shang, Momulla, and three or four of the others  would be absent from camp, exploring or hunting.  The Swede racked his  brain for some plan whereby he might successfully lure from the sight  of the anchored ship those whom he had determined to abandon.    To this end he organized hunting party after hunting party, but always  the devil of perversity seemed to enter the soul of Kai Shang, so that  wily celestial would never hunt except in the company of Gust himself.    One day Kai Shang spoke secretly with Momulla the Maori, pouring into  the brown ear of his companion the suspicions which he harboured  concerning the Swede.  Momulla was for going immediately and running a  long knife through the heart of the traitor.    It is true that Kai Shang had no other evidence than the natural  cunning of his own knavish soul--but he imagined in the intentions of  Gust what he himself would have been glad to accomplish had the means  lain at hand.    But he dared not let Momulla slay the Swede, upon whom they depended to  guide them to their destination.   They decided, however, that it would  do no harm to attempt to frighten Gust into acceding to their demands,  and with this purpose in mind the Maori sought out the self-constituted  commander of the party.    When he broached the subject of immediate departure Gust again raised  his former objection--that the warship might very probably be  patrolling the sea directly in their southern path, waiting for them to  make the attempt to reach other waters.    Momulla scoffed at the fears of his fellow, pointing out that as no one  aboard any warship knew of their mutiny there could be no reason why  they should be suspected.    
motioned to him that the coast was clear.    Jane Clayton and the Mosula woman were sitting at the opening of the  former's tent, their backs toward the approaching ruffians.  The first  intimation that either had of the presence of strangers in camp was the  sudden appearance of a half-dozen ragged villains about them.    "Come!" said Kai Shang, motioning that the two arise and follow him.    Jane Clayton sprang to her feet and looked about for Schneider, only to  see him standing behind the newcomers, a grin upon his face.  At his  side stood Schmidt.  Instantly she saw that she had been made the  victim of a plot.    "What is the meaning of this?" she asked, addressing the mate.    "It means that we have found a ship and that we can now escape from  Jungle Island," replied the man.    "Why did you send Mugambi and the others into the jungle?" she inquired.    "They are not coming with us--only you and I, and the Mosula woman."    "Come!" repeated Kai Shang, and seized Jane Clayton's wrist.    One of the Maoris grasped the black woman by the arm, and when she  would have screamed struck her across the mouth.    Mugambi raced through the jungle toward the south.  Jones and Sullivan  trailed far behind.  For a mile he continued upon his way to the relief  of Schmidt, but no signs saw he of the missing man or of any of the  apes of Akut.    At last he halted and called aloud the summons which he and Tarzan had  used to hail the great anthropoids.  There was no response.  Jones and  Sullivan came up with the black warrior as the latter stood voicing his  weird call.  For another half-mile the black searched, calling  occasionally.    Finally the truth flashed upon him, and then, like a frightened deer,  he wheeled and dashed back toward camp.   Arriving there, it was but a  moment before full confirmation of his fears was impressed upon him.  Lady Greystoke and the Mosula woman were gone.  So, likewise, was
